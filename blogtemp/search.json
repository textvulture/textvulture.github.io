    "text": "Naval Drones in Ukraine\n“Ukraine’s naval drone success holds a huge lesson for the U.S. Navy”\n\n“Without a standing navy of its own, Ukraine has disabled at least one-third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.”\nAnti-ship cruise missiles helped, but “Ukraine has also innovated brilliantly by developing its own unmanned surface vessels, which can hunt Russian warships in wolf packs.”\nUnmanned speed boats, only a few hundred thousand dollars, are sinking multi-million dollar warships, a story that has big implications for the inter-strait relationship. The drone technology gives advantage to defenders.\nJust like it was for battleships in WWII, carriers are now seem to be at the twilight of their days.\nThe US navy not entirely invested into the game perhaps due to the military contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats and Congress.\n\n\n\nAreas of importance for South Africa’s New Government\n“As President Takes Oath, 4 Challenges for South Africa’s New Government”\n\n\nANC got only 40% of the vote, resulting in a divided government. The second largest party, the Democratic Alliance that has been a staunch opponent to ANC, won 22%.\nBut ANC is not very much willing to share the power (i.e., sharing cabinet posts with other parties).\nThe economy is in a bad shape and the country is moving to the direction of privatization and deregulation. Both the incumbent president and Democratic Alliance in agreement seem to be in agreement on this.\nRacial disparity (e.g., land ownership) is the biggest issue of contention between ANC and DA.\nForeign policy: ANC has “agitated” the West but DA is more west-leaning.\n\n\n\nEconomic Consequences of the French electoral Result.\n“What would a far-right or leftwing government mean for France’s economy?”\n\nBoth far-right (RN) and hard-left (New Popular Front, NFP) parties of Francce are fiscal populists.\nThe far right:\n\npromises of easing the cost of living crisis (e.g., tax cuts on energy), implications for which are big fiscal holes.\npromises of the French contribution to the EU (which would be retaliated by not receiving the funding from the EU); reversing the pension reform\npromises of ending some tax cuts to fill the hole (but estimated too small in scale)\n\nThe hard-left:\n\na radical tax-and-spend plan (costing more than 100 bn euros)\nwage increase; reversing the pension reform\npromises of ‘squeezing the rich (and corporations)’ to fund the program (but the tax rates in France is already quite high)\n\n“The left would cause capital flight and the far right would cause a debt crisis.”\n\n\n\nRush to Indian Bonds as an alternative\n“JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds”\n\n“India’s $1.3 trillion in sovereign debt as fixed-income investors seek an alternative to Russia and China”\n“On June 28, JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to add Indian government debt to its biggest emerging-market bond index” and Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. and FTSE Russell are following the suit.\nPerhaps as a result, “In June, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a high, and the rupee has been the best-performing currency in emerging Asia against the dollar in 2024 even as the US currency has strengthened globally.”\nThe reason? “With China facing economic challenges, Russia isolated because of its invasion of Ukraine and no other obvious candidate poised to supplant them, India’s robust economic expansion has made it a top choice for investors seeking diversification” and the electoral setback that Modi suffered doesn’t seem to have much influence here."

    "text": "French Election, not the time to panic?\n“ECB chief economist plays down need to intervene in French bond market”\n\nECB says it won’t buy French bonds “after the announcement of a snap French parliamentary election caused a sell-off in the country’s debt.”\nBut the French budget situation has been less-than-ideal recently.\n\n\n\n\nECB granted itself the power to buy unlimited amount of a Eurozone country’s bods in 2022, but this has not been activated.\n“France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned last week that a victory by the RN could lead to a “debt crisis” similar to the market chaos fuelled by former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s mini-budget in 2022.”"

    "text": "China, UK, and Spies\n“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”\n\nThe UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.\nThe concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.\n\n\n\nSanctions and Consequences\n“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”\n\nIsraeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\n“Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”\n\nHe is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."

    "text": "The collapse of public support for the Tories\n“How Support for Britain’s Conservative Party is Collapsing”\n\n\n\n“voter moves”\n\n\n\nFewer than half of the former Tory voters are sticking with the party in the upcoming election. BREXIT, once a salient issue, is not as important any more. The economy (Liz Truss), health (longer waiting time for ‘elected care’), and immigration (consistently increased under the conservative rule) are more important than before.\nLabor is not in an overwhelmingly better position as they are forecast to lose some young voters (allegedly due to the their center-turn). Labor needs a comprehensive and substantial victory to win back the power. Their numbers hadn’t been quite there until recently, but they are improving now.\n\nThis nuanced point might be a bit too nuanced. The polls actually predict a complete wipeout of the Tories and an unprecedented victory for the Labor. For example: \n\n“One key test for Labour will be whether it can win back postindustrial heartlands in the Midlands and north of England, traditionally known as the “red wall.””\nThe Reform Party led by Farage could be a threat to the Conservative: “Unlike the Liberal Democrats, Reform’s voter base is spread thinly across the country, and, while that makes it difficult to win seats, it could split the right-wing vote across the country and cause the Conservatives to lose more seats to Labour.”\n\n\n\nChinese tech companies squeeze their workers for extended hours as their growth slows down\n“‘We’re like gears grinding until they break’: Chinese tech companies push staff to the limit”\n\nThe working conditions for the Chinese tech workers were traditionally bad. “But the unremitting schedule has improved in recent years under President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” campaign, which aims to reduce income inequality and promote fairness.” But as the growth of the sector slows down, they are going back to the “leaner and meaner start-up days.”\n“To boost their own efficiency, industry pillars Alibaba and Tencent have shed tens of thousands of staff since 2021.” The older workers are particularly in peril as their job market prospects are not great and the chances of redundancy high. Companies are searching for ‘young and unmarried’ workers.\nThe tech sector is considered the most coveted one among young Chinese, nonetheless because of its high pay.\nThere are some movements against the ‘996’ (9-to-9 for 6 days). “In 2021, with President Xi cracking down on personalities such as Ma, China’s supreme court declared the 996 schedule illegal. The victory did not come without costs. Authorities detained three labour activists involved in the campaign and sentenced them to prison terms of two to five years.”\n\n\n\nIn UCSF, doctors feud over Gaza given the ‘do no harm’ principle.\n“In San Francisco, Doctors Feud Over ‘Do No Harm’ When It Comes to War Protests”\n\n“People are coming here for chemotherapy. They have dire illnesses,” Dr. Terdiman said. “When that chant goes up and is heard in the patient care rooms, which it clearly was, it’s a violation of our professional obligations as health care providers.”\n“U.C.S.F. has a dress code prohibiting political symbols in patient care settings, but Dr. Ghannam said staff members for years have worn pins supporting abortion rights, Black Lives Matter and the L.G.B.T.Q. community without repercussions.”"
