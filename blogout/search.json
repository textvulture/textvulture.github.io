    "text": "Naval Drones in Ukraine\n“Ukraine’s naval drone success holds a huge lesson for the U.S. Navy”\n\n“Without a standing navy of its own, Ukraine has disabled at least one-third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.”\nAnti-ship cruise missiles helped, but “Ukraine has also innovated brilliantly by developing its own unmanned surface vessels, which can hunt Russian warships in wolf packs.”\nUnmanned speed boats, only a few hundred thousand dollars, are sinking multi-million dollar warships, a story that has big implications for the inter-strait relationship. The drone technology gives advantage to defenders.\nJust like it was for battleships in WWII, carriers are now seem to be at the twilight of their days.\nThe US navy not entirely invested into the game perhaps due to the military contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats and Congress.\n\n\n\nAreas of importance for South Africa’s New Government\n“As President Takes Oath, 4 Challenges for South Africa’s New Government”\n\n\nANC got only 40% of the vote, resulting in a divided government. The second largest party, the Democratic Alliance that has been a staunch opponent to ANC, won 22%.\nBut ANC is not very much willing to share the power (i.e., sharing cabinet posts with other parties).\nThe economy is in a bad shape and the country is moving to the direction of privatization and deregulation. Both the incumbent president and Democratic Alliance in agreement seem to be in agreement on this.\nRacial disparity (e.g., land ownership) is the biggest issue of contention between ANC and DA.\nForeign policy: ANC has “agitated” the West but DA is more west-leaning.\n\n\n\nEconomic Consequences of the French electoral Result.\n“What would a far-right or leftwing government mean for France’s economy?”\n\nBoth far-right (RN) and hard-left (New Popular Front, NFP) parties of Francce are fiscal populists.\nThe far right:\n\npromises of easing the cost of living crisis (e.g., tax cuts on energy), implications for which are big fiscal holes.\npromises of the French contribution to the EU (which would be retaliated by not receiving the funding from the EU); reversing the pension reform\npromises of ending some tax cuts to fill the hole (but estimated too small in scale)\n\nThe hard-left:\n\na radical tax-and-spend plan (costing more than 100 bn euros)\nwage increase; reversing the pension reform\npromises of ‘squeezing the rich (and corporations)’ to fund the program (but the tax rates in France is already quite high)\n\n“The left would cause capital flight and the far right would cause a debt crisis.”\n\n\n\nRush to Indian Bonds as an alternative\n“JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds”\n\n“India’s $1.3 trillion in sovereign debt as fixed-income investors seek an alternative to Russia and China”\n“On June 28, JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to add Indian government debt to its biggest emerging-market bond index” and Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. and FTSE Russell are following the suit.\nPerhaps as a result, “In June, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a high, and the rupee has been the best-performing currency in emerging Asia against the dollar in 2024 even as the US currency has strengthened globally.”\nThe reason? “With China facing economic challenges, Russia isolated because of its invasion of Ukraine and no other obvious candidate poised to supplant them, India’s robust economic expansion has made it a top choice for investors seeking diversification” and the electoral setback that Modi suffered doesn’t seem to have much influence here."

    "text": "China, UK, and Spies\n“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”\n\nThe UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.\nThe concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.\n\n\n\nSanctions and Consequences\n“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”\n\nIsraeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\n“Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”\n\nHe is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."

BREXIT, once a salient issue, is not as important any more. The economy (Liz Truss), health (longer waiting time for ‘elected care’), and immigration (consistently increased under the conservative rule) are more important than before.\nLabor is not in an overwhelmingly better position as they are forecast to lose some young voters (allegedly due to the their center-turn). Labor needs a comprehensive and substantial victory to win back the power. Their numbers hadn’t been quite there until recently, but they are improving now.\n\nThis nuanced point might be a bit too nuanced. The polls actually predict a complete wipeout of the Tories and an unprecedented victory for the Labor. For example: \n\n“One key test for Labour will be whether it can win back postindustrial heartlands in the Midlands and north of England, traditionally known as the “red wall.””\nThe Reform Party led by Farage could be a threat to the Conservative: “Unlike the Liberal Democrats, Reform’s voter base is spread thinly across the country, and, while that makes it difficult to win seats, it could split the right-wing vote across the country and cause the Conservatives to lose more seats to Labour.”\n\n\n\nChinese tech companies squeeze their workers for extended hours as their growth slows down\n“‘We’re like gears grinding until they break’: Chinese tech companies push staff to the limit”\n\nThe working conditions for the Chinese tech workers were traditionally bad. “But the unremitting schedule has improved in recent years under President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” campaign, which aims to reduce income inequality and promote fairness.” But as the growth of the sector slows down, they are going back to the “leaner and meaner start-up days.”\n“To boost their own efficiency, industry pillars Alibaba and Tencent have shed tens of thousands of staff since 2021.” The older workers are particularly in peril as their job market prospects are not great and the chances of redundancy high. Companies are searching for ‘young and unmarried’ workers.\nThe tech sector is considered the most coveted one among young Chinese, nonetheless because of its high pay.\nThere are some movements against the ‘996’ (9-to-9 for 6 days). “In 2021, with President Xi cracking down on personalities such as Ma, China’s supreme court declared the 996 schedule illegal. The victory did not come without costs.

They have dire illnesses,” Dr. Terdiman said. “When that chant goes up and is heard in the patient care rooms, which it clearly was, it’s a violation of our professional obligations as health care providers.”\n“U.C.S.F. has a dress code prohibiting political symbols in patient care settings, but Dr. Ghannam said staff members for years have worn pins supporting abortion rights, Black Lives Matter and the L.G.B.T.Q. community without repercussions.”"

He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."

In fact, as I get older writing–really the biggest part of my job description–is becoming increasingly hard. So hard to the point where I need some anchor. Hopefully this blog serves that purpose. So it is mostly for myself.\nHere are some ground rules that I will try to adhere to, but also constantly think about change for improvement.\n\nI will talk about at least three but no more than five media pieces. Given my media consumption, it’s going to be most likely from NYT and FT.\nI will pay extra attention to the tags (categories), for the purpose of the ex-post organization.\nI won’t spend more than 45 minutes for this excercise. I might want to use a timer for this."

Just two months ago, Biden had an obvious upper hand here (by about 100mn).\nThe felony verdicts probably drove the fund raising: “The Trump campaign has said it raised $53 million online in the first 24 hours and $70 million in the first 48 hours after the verdict.”\nNonetheless, ““But at the end of the day, Biden has the funds that he needs to run a really strong campaign.””\n\na related news article: “US banking heir gave Trump campaign fund $50mn after ex-president’s conviction”\nan opinion piece related to this: “Business leaders’ myopic reversal on Donald Trump”\n\n\n\n\nCentral Bankers’ limits [op-ed]\n“Markets ignore the internal politics of central banks at their peril”\n\n\n“Neither the US Federal Reserve’s Jay Powell nor the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde is a certified member of the central bankers’ club. Lacking the economics training and record, they must operate as deft chairs of technocratic boards.”\n\nPowell is a Georgetown JD (with a investment banking career); Largarde has law and English degrees (MA) from France with experiences in the law (antitrust) and bureaucracy.\n\nThe lack of their won expertise renders decision making ‘constrained’ by data.

The other, anti-Muslim threats. Both signaled that there may be little room for agreement.”\n“The report on antisemitism — by a university subcommittee on antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, consisting of faculty, students and an alumnus — found that acts of antisemitism have ranged from an anonymous threat on social media against a student journalist who had written about antisemitism to what students said was intimidation in the classroom and residence halls.”\n\nexamples: “a social media message calling for a student journalist to be “waterboarded with gas and set on fire” after he wrote an essay about antisemitism; an instructor who had told students that “only six million” Jews had died in the Holocaust, and compared it with the 12 million deaths in colonial Belgium; and mezuzahs, a religious talisman, being ripped from some students’ door frames.”\n\n“The other report — by Stanford’s Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities committee — described what it called “a rupture of trust” between students, staff and faculty. “These communities have felt afraid for their safety, unseen and unheard by university leadership,” it said.”\n\nexamples: “a threatening email from a Stanford alumnus to two undergraduate members of Students for Justice in Palestine with the subject line, “College Terror List — You Made It!”; a professor haranguing students at a pro-Palestinian protest, accusing them of doing “the work of Islamic jihad and Hamas”; and a printout of a Palestinian flag taken off a student’s door and ripped in half.”"

This includes “the far-left La France Insoumise, led by anti-capitalist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon.” Broken down into the party-level, though, the biggest party is the far right France Unbowed with 74 seats. The Socialists, 59.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, major cabinet members, including the prime minister, are asked to remain in their posts.\n\nThe government forming remains a difficult task. The far-left block, for example, is a hard sell to macron: “But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with Mélenchon. Speaking after last Sunday’s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal – Macron’s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a “credible alternative” to the far right.” CNN article\n\nThe left seem to deal with some internal tensions, which is reflected in the comments like: “Mathilde Panot, a high-level figure in Mélenchon’s party, told RTL radio on Monday that the veteran leftwinger was “absolutely not disqualified” for the prime minister job.”\n\n\n\nResurging Investment Banking\n“Dealmaking revival expected to boost results for Wall Street banks”\n\nInvestment banking fee recovery is expected to boost lenders.\n\nInvestment banking revenues at “JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup will on average rise more than 30 per cent from a year earlier during the second quarter.”\nSome examples of the resurgence of deal-making: “ExxonMobil’s $60bn acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, which was brokered by Citigroup, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and Aon’s $13bn purchase of insurance broker NFP in April, which was guided by Citi and BofA, among others.”\n\nThe background is that the investment banking revenues had fallen in 2023 from record highs in 2021. The interest rates are to blame. For that reason, though, the current resurgence may fall short of reaching the 2021 level because the peak was made possible through the low interest rates and Covid stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the reflection of the private equity funds’ activities?\n\n\n\n\nThe disappointing economic effect of AI (revolution)\nWhat happened to the artificial-intelligence revolution?\n\n“[F]or ai to fulfil its potential, firms everywhere need to buy the technology, shape it to their needs and become more productive as a result.”\n\nMost ‘say’ they use AI in their business, but often for marginal tasks. More over, the surveys on this subjects remain limited to a few very slective companies. “[T]he incorporation of ai into business processes remains a niche pursuit.”\nIn surveys on a more representative sample, a single-digit percentage of respondents say they us AI for business purposes.\n\nThe obstacles? “Concerns about data security, biased algorithms and hallucinations are slowing the roll-out.”\nMost important, the AI use does not seem to have impacts in the economic outputs, reflected in the labor market.\n\n“there is no sign in the macroeconomic data of a surge in lay-offs.” (but one needs to consider that the labor market is currently very strong.)\nWorkers are not moving between companies faster than usual, either. (All these numbers are focused on white-collar jobs. But AI may more quickly replace blue-color jobs?)\nThere doesn’t seem to be any surge in productivity or capital investment either.\n\nMust of what is suggested here is looking at the very last node of the AI revolution and its impact on the economy. So a bit too early to declare the lack of signs?"

Venezuelans living outside the country need to register to be able to vote. But the authorities are effectively blocking the regristration using the law that “citizens abroad to possess “residence” or “legal permanence” in the country where they live to be eligible to vote.”\n\nOf 21 mn electorate, between 3.5 and 5.5 mn live abroad. Many of these people probably would vote against Maduro, who is not currently doing very well in the polls\n\nEssentially a case of disenfranchisement.\n\n\n\nUBS vs. Switzerland\n“How UBS fell out with Switzerland’s establishment after rescuing Credit Suisse”\n\nUBS, a Swiss-based investment bank and financial service company, seems to have a bad relationship with the Swiss authority.\n\nUBS bought (or ‘saved’) Credit Suisse last year. The deal was controversial as it generated about $ 17bn loss around the world. Local politicians weren’t happy with it either (“UBS was handed the “deal of the century” at the expense of the Swiss people”).\n\nThe subjects over which the two party publicly quarrel are various: e.g., executive pay; capital requirements. The latter created frictions as some believe that the failures of the Credit Suisse weren’t due to the lack fo capital.\n\nBut “[m]uch of the recent disagreement centres around plans to bolster the country’s financial system after the body blow of losing its second-biggest bank, in a public spat playing out between a group of newly hired leaders.”\n\n\n\n\nUK foreign policy under a Labour government\n(“What does Labour’s win mean for British foreign policy?”)[https://www-economist-com.mutex.gmu.edu/britain/2024/07/09/what-does-labours-win-mean-for-british-foreign-policy]\n\nthe expectation is that Sr. Keir Starmer wants to portray the UK differently than before: “Almost overnight an exaggerated image of Britain as a chaotic clown-show—true under Boris Johnson, a bit less so for Rishi Sunak—has flipped to an idealised image of stable government led by a serious-minded centrist.”\n\nMuch of the foreign policy fundamentals though will remain unchanged. Unlike, Corbyn, for example, the commitment to NATO is strong.\n“As for China, Labour has promised a full audit of its relationship with the country” and some incoming cabinet members made some hawkish remarks. But, in reality, things will remain pretty much the same, which is “to maintain openness towards consumer-goods trade” while “taking a sceptical view of Chinese investment in nuclear, telecoms and other sensitive areas.”\n\nThe discontinuity will be on the relationship with the EU, which is expected to improve (though the party has ruled out rejoining the EU).\n\nA security-and-defence cooperation agreement is a possibility."

    "text": "Iran’s new president\n“Iran’s New President Promises Changes. Can He Deliver?”\n\n“Masoud Pezeshkian, a widowed doctor, portrays himself as a reformer who can bring social and economic shifts.” “He has portrayed himself as a modern leader for a new era in Iran, a religious man who considered his wife an equal partner when she was alive.”\n\nHe “has sought to come across not as a disrupter but as a more pragmatic fixer.” To be a fixer though, he “will have to bargain with Mr. Khamenei.”\nHe is “Iran’s most credentialed president” with the academic background and foreign-language fluency–and training in Harvard. He was also a student activist during the revolution and a volunteer surgeon during the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nIn a column, he described his foreign policy as ‘opportunity-driven.’ The ties with China and Russia are emphasized; the cooperation with Europe is open; but wouldn’t back down to the US pressure. (in an optimistic interpretation, the last one would be more of face-saving?)\nCritics say his reform agendas are limited against the deeply entrenched Iranian establishment.\n\n\n\nBOA problems\n“Bank of America profits fall as it pushes up provision for bad loans”\n\n“BofA’s profits fell 7 per cent to $6.9bn, [though] a smaller drop than the 10 per cent analysts had projected.” Their “interest income fell for the third quarter in a row” despite the growth in other areas of Wall Street activities.\nIn essence, an indicator showing “strain of higher rates on banks and borrowers”\n\n\n\nNot news: bothsidesism mystery\nIt is really a great mystery (and thus pure pain to me who’s too partisan and emotionally invested to remain a simple bystander) as to how bothsidesism is prevalent in the election year mainstream news media in the United States and beyond. I can only conjecture that the real culprit is the desk given that the contents aren’t as extremely normalizing the far-right as the titles and images. Nonetheless, the extent to which the media avoid confronting the apparent anti-democratic and rule-breaking aspect of the American far right is mind-boggling."

The actions includes (but are not limited to):\n\nwriting a WaPo column (“The brave”) upon the request from her ‘handler’ in DC (and perhaps another op-ed in Foreign Affairs much earlier)\npassing notes after non-public meeting with the State Department (including Blinken)\nreceiving monetary compensations including luxury bags\n\nThe indictment indicates that there have been three ‘handlers’ in Korean embassy, all of which were NIS (National Intelligence Service of RoK) agents. The operation seems to have started in 2013, two years after she left CIA.\nThere’s no hard evidence indicating differing patterns of the operation between different admins, but it seems that during the Moon presidency, the NIS agents were seeking intelligence through Terry, while in Park and Yoon governments, what was asked for seems to be more of cheer-leading.\nGiven the inconsistency between the foreign policy orientations of the Moon government and Terry, what this incident implies is that NIS could have been pursuing its own missions, independent of the government, when it comes to the NK matters.\n\nAnother possibility, provided that Terry, who was a NK specialist and not necessarily a high-profile foreign policy person in DC, might not have had whole a lot of critical information to offer to begin with, is that the NIS handler was desperate for any intel to ‘brag about’ so as to justify their and their operation’s existence. If this is the case, it would be quite disappointing, not only because it reflects the Korean bureaucratic manerism creeping over the most important policy realm but also because it reveals that a high-ranking national intelligent officer does not have a direct contact with the State department people and instead has to rely on a third-party former-CIA analyst. Itis pretty sad. So much for the ironclad alliance.\n\nProbably a huge blow to the DC think-tank communities on Korea.\nwhy did they love sushi restaurants so much?\n\n\n\nMarket reaction to Trump: treasury boand\n“Investors revive ‘Trump trade’ in bet on US bonds”\n\n“The growing prospect of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election in November has helped revive a popular hedge fund bet on Treasury yields”\nThe market is betting on the short-term treasury bonds as Trump’s “tax-cutting and pro-trade tariff agenda could eventually lead to higher inflation and a greater supply of longer-dated government bonds.” The expectation is that the long-term bonds would outperform the short-term bonds.\n\n\n\n“[T]he bet — known in industry jargon as a “steepener” because of the expected move in the yield curve — has paid off, with the two-year yield falling by roughly double the drop in the 10-year. Prices move inversely to yields.”"

It might counter, though perhaps only marginally, the narrative that Harris clinching the nomination without an open primary is undemocratic. The prudence might also counter the long-standing conspiracy theory of the far right.\n\n\n\n\nTough US Job Market\n“US graduates face cut-throat job market as companies scrap internships”\n\nmajor companies in US are cutting internships: “Goldman Sachs hired 200 fewer summer analysts this year than in 2023. JPMorgan reduced the size of its own class of summer analysts by 600, more than ten per cent of the total. Tesla rescinded its internship offers just weeks before students were due to start.”\nZipRecruiter says that the year-to-year difference is negative 14 percent. The “traditional, white-colllar” jobs are particularly getting cut.\nMuch less enthusiasm: “Sean McGowan, director of employer relations at Carnegie Mellon University, said companies had this year taken months longer than normal to commit to attending his college’s hiring fairs for summer internships. Those that did come relied more heavily on virtual interviews, instead of flying out recruiters to meet students.”\nThe trend made the competition more intense: “Goldman Sachs received 315,000 applications for fewer than 3,000 roles. JPMorgan received 493,000 applications, an 82 per cent increase from last summer.”\n\n\n\nChina ramping up the pressure on the new Taiwanese president\n“Taiwan’s Blunt-Talking Leader Faces China’s Backlash”\n\nLai Ching-te’s campaign promise was to maintain Tsai Ing-wen’s China policy which was to avoid confrontations. The policy itself might not have changed, but his speeches on China became much “blunter.”\nThe “officials in Beijing seemed taken aback by how starkly he drew a line between Taiwan and China in his high-profile May inauguration speech,” in which he stated that “dialogue with Beijing is only possible if the two sides negotiate as separate equals, not … based on the idea that each side accepts that it is part of one Chinese nation.”\n\nTaiwanese leaders emphasizing equality is not new; but doing so in the inauguration speech, given its symbolic importance, is new.\n\nBeijing has attempted some military forays into Taiwan’s aerial and maritime territories but is worried that such pressures are not resulting in the desired effect.\n\nBeijing released a new ‘guideline’ furthering and detailing the ‘illegality’ of independence movement. Taiwanese authority warned their citizens about traveling to China. Mr. Lai, in response, wrote in the social media that “Democracy is not a crime; autocracy is what’s truly malicious.”"

    "text": "private equlity generates so much debt, which is a global threat\n“How private equity tangled banks in a web of debt”\n\n\nPrivate equity grew through the low-interest environment, which enabled them to purchase firms easily. In the process, banks constructed multiple connections with the actors of PEFs such as “ending to buyout-owned companies, the funds that acquire them, the firms that manage them and the investors that back them.”\n\ninterest rate hikes can upend all this, posing essentially a big risk to banks.\n\nSo how does a PEF operates (to by companies), ending up affecting banks?\n\nAt the beginning, a PE firm will launch a fund with partners (executives), who are “responsible for managing the fund.” Limited partners (outside investors) might pitch in some cash too. These partners may borrow from banks “to finance their commitment to the fund.” This borrowing may generate collateral, which are the partners’ “existing stakes in other funds.”\n\n\nIn return, a general partner gets paid of a fee (for managing the fund) “as well as a share of the profits from successful investments.”\n\n\nWhat amounted to the borrowing that reaches $900 bn in 2023 is the subscription line: “short-term financing used to acquire companies before cash from limited partners is tapped.” The money from limited partners is used as security for a subscription line. But a subscription line plays only a partial role\nThe primary resource to complete a company-buying deal is simply debt financing (borrowing) from banks. The cash generated by the business of the bought company is used to pay off this debt. This debt might be sold to others, but the bank has to hold on to it if the demand is weak.\nPEFs will repeat the process of 1-3 and end up owning multiple companies (or a portfolio of companies). Using these companies as collateral, the fund can also borrow&lt;&gt; directly from banks. Such money can either bail out a struggling company (which is a ‘leverage on leverage’) or fund a payout to investors (net asset value financing: $100 bn in 2023). Overall a high-leverage structure.\n‘Secondaries funds’ can buy stakes from limited partners. For a bit of discounts, this gives limited partners some cash upfront. The secondaries may also borrow from the bank to finance this.\nIndividual companies (owned by PEFs) may also borrow directly from bank to boost returns for investors. (this borrowing reached $30 bn in 2024)\n‘General partner stakes funds’ can buy the funds’ stake directly from general partners. To fund this purchase, they may also borrow&gt; from banks.\n\nSome big examples of this kind of buyout model: Caesars Entertainment (casino); Alliance Boots (pharma chain)\nsome big PE firms specialized in this kind of processes (secondaries fund): Blackstone, Ardian. Other financial actors buy shares of this kind of PF firms.\nIn a high interest rate environment, all these borrowings add up. And partners seek more liquidity upon growing pressure, initiating a negative spiral.\n‘Private credit funds’ also have been lending just like banks. They have much less transparency or liquidity than banks. But because they are lending to the same actors/actions as the banks do, a shock emanating from the private credit market will shake banks.\n\n\n\nTech stocks sink.\n“Global tech stocks sink as sell-off spreads to Europe and Asia”\n\n“Global tech stocks sank on Thursday as a Wall Street sell-off spread to Europe and Asia.”; “The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent after the opening bell on Wall Street, extending its recent slump following the worst day in 18 months.”\nChipmakers (Nvidia and Arm Holdings) led the downward trend. Disappoint earnings reports and geopolitical tensions are said to be the culprits. German, Japanese (particularly dramatic), and South Korean chipmakers stocks also showed similar patterns."

Bans”\n\nThe high-performance chips (e.g., A100) produced by Nvidia are necessary conditions for development of AI. US companies have been prohibited from selling these chips to China, an initiative started in the Trump admin and continued in the Biden admin.\n\nThe reason is mostly military. The military application of the AI technology is a new front in US-China competition. The goal of the embargo is not to block the supply of the sought-after chips entirely (which is impossible) but “to hold China back during a critical window in which the United States can pull ahead.”\nBut it’s questionable if even this goal is being fulfilled because private entities that trade chips effectively evade the embargo by, for example, enlisting new companies for the old operations.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for the AI ban operation acknowlege that the embargo may not perfectly prevent the chip sales. The Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo (who overseas BIS), also admits this.\n\nUS companies are already taking on, allegedly, billions of dollars of financial costs due to the ‘AI ban.’ This pent-up pressure explains why as soon as any loophole in the embargo is identified, the trades surge. These chips eventually show up in China through private entities who, in both countries, vehemently deny that they ever breach the regulation.\n\nSome of the events that spooked Washington includes a hypersonic missile test, which implies theoretically that China can send in nuclear warheads to US soil without being detected: “Six months into the Biden administration, China tested a weapon that shook U.S. officials: a hypersonic missile that circled the earth.”\n\n\n\nBuffett sells Apple shares\n“Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway halves stake in Apple”\n\nBuffett “dumped $76bn of stocks” of Apple selling half of its shares. This led “Berkshire’s cash holdings to a record high of $277bn, up $88bn from the previous quarter.” This is the largest cash holding for his compnay, ever.\nBut Buffett also stated in the recent (May) meeting that they will keep investing in Apple “unless something dramatic” happens.\n\nThis could simply indicates the ‘valuation discipline,’ which makes sense given how the Magficent-7’s prices soared so rapidly.\nThe move also makes sense given how the company benefited from Fed’s rate policies in the past two years.\n\n\n{width=“75%”, align=‘center’}"

    "title": "TSMC struggles in AZ; Data-driven Market bounce-back; autocratizers temper with CBI?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Doing Asian-style business with few Asians proves hard.\n“What Works in Taiwan Doesn’t Always in Arizona, a Chipmaking Giant Learns”\n\nTSMC is building factories in northern AZ, modeling after its facilities back in Taiwan. But even before opening them, they are running into problems: the tension between American workers (engineers) and Taiwanese management on work culture.\n\nunscheduled overtime and out-of-job-description work are quite common, but engineers in AZ aren’t getting it.\n\nThe project, partly funded by CHIPS act, was thought of as a glaring success: “It would boost advanced chip making in the United States and help diversify TSMC’s manufacturing away from Taiwan, an island democracy that is the focus of increasingly aggressive geopolitical claims by China.”\nThe factory also is competing with others (e.g., INTEL) for limited supply of engineers. Local universities (ASU in particular) and community colleges–and even some high schools–are bringing in labor forces, but it seems grossly insufficient.\n\n\n\nTrump wants to interfere with Fed’s rate decisions\n“Trump Suggests that President Should Have a ‘Say’ in Interest Rates”\n\nTrump said: ““I feel that the president should have at least say in there, yeah, I feel that strongly”; “I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman.”\nThis is hardly a first time: he made “a habit of loudly criticizing Fed policy while he was in office, often personally attacking” Powell. He “flirted with the idea of firing” Powell while he was in office, though its legal basis, even if he’d done that, is questionable.\nHe doesn’t probably want an immediate rate reduction though: “Mr. Trump pushed incessantly for low interest rates while he was in office, but has made it clear a few times in recent months that he would see any move to lower rates ahead of the election as a political bid to help Democrats.”\n\n\n\nJob data help the market comeback\n“Wall Street rallies in best day since 2022 as data helps ease growth fears”\n\nThe stock markets made a comeback with the unemployment claims data release. A reduction (from 250k to 233k) implies the resilience of the economy.\n\n“The benchmark S&P 500 share gauge rose 2.3 per cent, closing out its best day in almost 21 months, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.9 per cent — its biggest daily gain since February.”\nDays ago, the market freaked out about the negative outlook of recession, so this reversal makes sense."

    "text": "Japanese and South Korean governments are covering up a dark truth about Sado Mine.\n“Japan’s Sado Island Gold Mines Designated as UNESCO World Heritage Site With South Korea’s Backing”\n\n“Sado Island Gold Mines’ designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in late July.”\nWhy the UNESCO recognition?: “[S]ome 50 mines whose long history traverses Japan’s traditional era, industrialization, and imperialism.”\n\n“Japan’s successful UNESCO application for the Sado mines is based solely on their legacy from the Edo period (1603-1867).”\nBy 17th century, the mines achieved an unparalleled manual gold purification system, along with much cultural richness around it.\nTokyo’s argument: the mines are indicative of “the socio-technical sophistication of the Edo period, which played an invaluable role in both Japan’s socio-cultural development and global trade.”\n\nThe problem: while the application to UNESCO was built around the pre-modern period, the history of the Sado mines didn’t stop there.\n\nthe late 19th through early 20th centuries: Sado mines funded the militarist government.\nJapan started fixing the yen to gold after the Sino-Japan War. Mitsubishi Materials took over the mines’ operations. The gold mined out of Sado mines bought warships and weapons. Through the annexation of Korea, Russo-Japanese War, and the second Sino-Japanese war the Mitsubishi-owned mines “bankrolled” Japanese war efforts.\nForced labor:\n\nIn the Pacific War, the mines turned themselves into other war-related minerals such as copper and zinc. But Mitsubishi struggled the government’s production target.\n“Japan’s National General Labor Mobilization Law, passed in 1938, enabled Mitsubishi to collect forced laborers from Korea in early 1939.” About 2300 were estimated to be forced to work in the mines. The victims had to pay their own mining tools while their pays slashed. Their families were brought in to prevent their escapes. They were put into the most grueling and dangerous tasks.\n\n\nCover-up efforts: The Japanese authorities minimized, downplayed, and distorted the labor abuse in the war efforts of the Sado mines during WWII even though UNESCO inquired if they would cover the ‘whole’ story.\n\nThe practice is not an isolated incident. A series of historical revisionism and denialism while trying to glorify Japanese historical ‘heritage’ have taken place recently. This tendency is deeply entrenched in the long-held Japanese foreign policy philosophy.\n“The Kishida administration has found a perfect accomplice in South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol in laundering Japan’s history.” “The Yoon administration has plumped for South Korea’s New Right movement, which justifies Japan’s occupation of Korea as a source of modernity and enlightenment and glosses over colonial atrocities and the elite’s collaboration.”\n\n\n\n\nUkraines Incursion into Russia\n“Russian reinforcements fail to push back Ukrainian incursion”\n\n“Russia has failed to push back Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region despite sending in reinforcements as the incursion enters its sixth day.”\n\n“[V]erified videos and photographs show Ukrainian troops and equipment have advanced 30km inside Russia since the operation began on Tuesday, moving further into Kursk and occupying the town of Sudzha near the Russian border,” which the Russian authorities are trying to downplay.\n\n“Russia has evacuated more than 76,000 civilians from the Kursk border region. Smirnov referred to the Ukrainian forces as sabotage and reconnaissance groups, and said they had caused panic.”\npolitical intentions?: “Analysts have said Ukraine may be seeking to use the Kursk offensive to improve its position in potential talks. It is losing territory and men in eastern Ukraine and is still struggling to resolve ammunition and manpower shortages.”\n\n\n\nWalz is no ‘pro-China’ guy.\n“Tim Walz’s Long Relationship With China Defies Easy Stereotypes”\n\nHe taught in China and visited the country 30 times, but is skeptical of the country’s human rights situations.\n\nHe taught at a high school in southern China, for one year, immediately after the Tinanmen Square Massacre.\nAs high school teachers, Walz and his wife visited China many times, often bringing students along to introduce them to a different culture.\n\nWhile in Congress, “[h]e took a special interest in Tibet and Hong Kong, meeting with both the Dalai Lama and Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist.”"

The Serbian mine was expected to address this shortage.\n“But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia where fears that the mine will poison the air and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic.”\nSerb government’s swinging positions: “The Serbian government gave preliminary approval in 2019, but, worried about losing votes during protests against Rio Tinto before a 2022 election, canceled it.”\n\n“Under pressure from the European Union, which Serbia aspires to join, the government changed its mind in July, allowing Rio Tinto to revive the project.”\n\n\nA profit issue: lithium prices have been declining recently. The profitability will be an issue for the success of the project (and for Rio Tinto) moving forward.\nGeopolitically, the mine project is also the west’s attempt to “extract” Serbia from Russia (Serbia’s traditional ally) and China.\n\nHardline, pro-Russia, ultranationalist groups are in strong opposition to the mine project.\nBut “leftists and middle-of-the-road” Serbians also jointed the protest for environmental reasons. The grievance against the current goverment ‘selling out to foreigners’ is also at work."

Now back to the normalcy.\n\n\nUS presidential debate, maybe one-sided victory?\n“Kamala Harris makes Donald Trump look out of his depth”\n\nThe Economist declares it was a ‘success’ for Harris. Other outlets seem to have similar takes.\nThe pattern was rather simple (but effective): “Harris baited hook after hook … [and] each time [Trump] lunged for it” by forcing him defend his own records, instead of initiating attacks on her.\n\n“she made the former president look small and angry and out of his depth.”\n\nHarris seemed less confident in the first 15 minutes. But she quickly made it up.\nThe ABC hosts did a reasonable job of fact checking and following up (particularly on Trump). But in my view, they still, way too often, let Trump ramble out of contexts.\nWhether this debate performance actually translates into poll numbers and, more importantly, votes remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nItaly’s new corporate governance law\n“Italy to review corporate governance rules after shareholder pressure”\n\nInternational Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) pressured the Meloni government to review the new law\n\nThe government reacted that ICGN’s concerns have the ‘utmost importance.’\n“The new financial markets law could overrule certain aspects of the capital markets bill approved in March,” which aimed at making Italy look more attractive to outside investors.\nexamples of the controversy:\n\n“The new law on board appointments replaces a system that was unique to Italy but that overseas investors had grown used to, even though critics said it was complex and too often meant little turnover of board members.”\n“rules allowing shareholder meetings behind closed doors with investors designating a representative would damage smaller shareholders and compromise transparency.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street vs. Fed on capital regulations\n“How Wall Street won ‘capitulation’ from the Federal Reserve on new bank rules”\n\nMichael Barr, Fed VC, walked back the regulations he proposed in the aftermath of the banking crisis (e.g., SVB) in line with BASEL III, requiring banks of higher levels of capital.\n\nThe backdrop is “after one of the fiercest opposition campaigns from the banking lobby and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers.”\n\n” That the criticism also came in part from Democratic lawmakers did not help [the regulators’] cause.”\nBasel III implementation has been tricky because of the wide pushback. [related article: “The US pushback against ‘Basel Endgame’”]\n\n\nThe retreat seems to be the reduction of the capital requirement rate (from 19% to 9%). This allows banks to take more risks than they would’ve.\n\nIn a similar context, BOE announced that the new bank regulations will be delayed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why the market bets against USD when Trump’s odds dip?\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Trump’s platform is nothing new. More so with his current plans involving tariffs and overall isolationism. These all have pretty straightforward inflationary implications. With inflation expected, one would bet against USD when Trump’s odds go up. And the opposite should be the case when Trump’s odds dip–as with the release of the ‘surprising’ Iowa poll.\nBut what’s being observed is not consistent with this reasoning. Instead, the dollar gets weaker with Trump’s chances get slimmer. Why? Because, as FT notes:\n\nInvestors believe that if Trump wins and implements trade tariffs and tax cuts — and especially if the Republicans also emerge with control of both houses of Congress — then inflationary pressures will rise, making it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will rapidly cut interest rates. The Fed is expected to lower rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, two days after the election.\n\nSo yes, it’s all about the rate cuts (or lack thereof). If Trump wins, Fed would slow down on rate cuts, which keeps the dollar’s nominal value high–or higher than expected, to be precise. The market would hold onto that. What it also implies is the exchange market behavior, once again, reflects short-term gains like arbitrage rather than long-term economic health or uncertainty. Maybe the latter have already been baked into the current dollar pricing."

It might depend on what your prior was like, but I don’t think that 77% of Black men voting for the Dem, with the caveat of not accounting for those who stayed home) is indicative of ‘black men abandoning Harris’ narrative. Nor is white women predominantly (53%) voting for Trump consistent with the expectation that the election was primarily about abortion. Harris getting not that many Latino men (43%) and women (60%) seems to question the implicit assumption that the broad Dem voting coalition includes Latinos.\nLikewise, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that Biden’s economic policies were too lefty (or too righty). For that to be at work (given their distributional implications), we should see a significant rally for Trump among centrist/moderate voters. Or there should probably be some notable patterns along income groups. We don’t seem to see that:\n Maybe, moderate voters stayed home because they were spooked by the supposedly radical (anti-)distributional policies of Biden. But with 34% of the voters declaring themselves independent, I don’t know that number could be unusually large this year.\nSo, again, it’s a wide sweep. A rightward shift across almost all sociocultural and economic groups.\nThis wide and substantial a shift cannot be explained without looking at the issues associated with the fundamentals. In fact, in the same FT article, this bar graphs offers some answers for the question:\n\nTrump supporters are much more likely say inflation and immigration are the top priority issues, compared to the Dem voters who tend to say democracy and abortion were important. Notable is how insignificant foreign policy is in the mind of voters from both sides. Be it Ukraine or Gaza, things outside of the US (once again) do not amount to the issue of primary significance for American voters.\nThis partisan divide in itself is not surprising, of course. Inflation and immigration are both retrospective voting issues where the incumbent is severely disadvantaged. What is (mildly) surprising is the sheer degree of its potency. It seems to have overwhelmed all other issues that people long suspected to be crucial–culture and identity issues in particular.\nAnd it’s not even just the US. All around the world this year, the incumbents suffered electorally in a historically unprecedented manner. This FT graph summarizes it nicely:\n\nIn Japan, India, France, and the UK, the incumbents lost votes significantly regardless of their ideological leanings. Two common factors are inflation and immigration. High prices and (perceived) social upheaval brew anxiety and fear, which are electorally potent. And what happened in the US–the electoral importance of these issues–can be understood in this context.\nThe prediction models published before the election now make a whole lot of sense. This Enns et al. paper, for example, near-perfectly predicts the result, if we look at the mode outcome of their simulations. The simulation result is intuitively visualized here:\n\nI don’t know what this really means at a more structural level. After all, American politics isn’t my field. One thing is pretty clear, though. As the literature has repeatedly suggested, retrospective voting dominates but voters are not necessarily well-informed. They vote holistically. Trump’s economic policies, for example, are perhaps more inflationary than Biden’s. But that either does not matter to most voters or is not least communicated very well to them. The influx of immigrants and how they ended up in big cities during the Biden admin does not really threaten the quality of life in suburban Midwesterners. But they would still be terrified to see the (perceived) disruptions in the cities and take them as signs of how the nation is going to a wrong direction. Migrants hosted in downtown hotels of the cities where chronic (and increasingly serious) homeless problems reported in the media would fuel the fear.\nAnd people were pretty serious about all this. For instance, there are more Trump supporters than Harris’s among the first time voters, who are less likely to vote as a political habit. It takes them, compared to the ‘serial voters’, more to go out and vote (from the NBC’s Exit Poll article above)\n Nor were there many voters who remained on the fence for a while and reluctantly chose to vote:\n\nAll along, people were terrified and they wanted to express it, whether that makes sense or not.\nWhat that also implies is that with an alternative candidate, it would still have been an uphill battle for the Dems. The incumbent disadvantage was too hefty, it turns out. With quite a few people deciding to vote for Harris in September, in fact, Harris perhaps was a reasonably strong candidate who ran a good campaign.\nSo what happens now? I really don’t know. I find these words of Moynihan and Pepinsky compelling."

    "text": "Voter Turnout in US 2024 Election\n source: Foreign Policy\nThe turnout in 2024 was projected to be about 65%. It’s definitely lower than 2020, which was the historic 67%–but not by too much. It suggests that the election wasn’t about ‘too many people staying home.’ This is particularly so given that the 2020 election was a special one. People were terrified of how the Pandemic would unfold while the economy was bad. Mail ballots were much easier to access. The turnout in 2024 seems pretty similar to 2020. The result therefore seems more a function of the retrospective voting on incumbent in an environment that favors the opposition heavily.\nWhat do the Dems have to do going forward? As much as he’s known for fumbling the ball occasionally, this ‘manifesto’ of Yglesias rings bell."

So, “[t]his is the era of institutional crypto capture.”\n\n\n“bitcoin, conceived as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would eliminate the need for financial intermediaries, is now primarily traded through funds managed by the very intermediaries it was meant to circumvent.”\n\n\nThe … embrace of crypto is less a validation of its alleged revolutionary potential and more an attempt to extract fees from what is, essentially, gambling. It has effectively neutered crypto’s radical promise of disintermediation.\n\n\nBut the guardrails aren’t set. Instead, asset managers are increasingly pressured to include crypto in the portfolio.\n\n\n\nFord Job Cut in Europe\n“Ford to cut 4,000 jobs in Europe”\n\nThe job cut reflects the pressure coming from slowing growth of EVs as well as the competition with China. This is not new. Ford has struggled in Europe for quite a long time.\nVokswagen similarly plans to close three plants in Germany.\nThe transition to EV itself also requires less labor.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs and/in China\n“Inside Goldman Sachs’ years-long power struggle over its China venture”\n\n\nFang Fenglei, Goldman Sachs’ early partner in China who was mentored by Wang Qishan, “wove himself into the fabric of the bank’s Chinese operations and forced it to pay far more than it had expected to gain full ownership of the business.”\n\nThe story is indicative of how difficult it is for even a finance giant like GS to operate in China against a local partner who is a real insider.\nWang Qishan eventually became Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption Czar.\n\nFang was involved in GS’s operations in China through the joint venture, Gao Hua, and vice versa.\n\nThe breaking point was when China raised the cap on foreign ownership. GS wanted a new arrangement where Fang had marginal profits. But Fang wanted a new deal that can deliver a bonanza for him. GS couldn’t find an alternative partner as well connected to CCP as Fang. Lengthy negotiations ensued.\n\nEventually Fang retained the full control of Gao Hua. Dividens did not go to GS.\nGoldman eventually ‘bought back’ Gao Hua and its related operations."

    "text": "After 6 months of turmoil following an attempted coup, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party is poised to clinch victory in South Korea’s 21st presidential election. While many aspects of this election merit extensive discussion, one in particular stands out to me.\n\nLee made significant gains in the conservative strongholds of the Gyeongsang provinces—an unequivocal rebuke of Yoon and his coup attempt. The regional cleavage in South Korean politics is so deeply entrenched that people often joke a conservative party’s flag alone could win an election there. Traditionally, Democratic candidates have struggled in the region. In the past three presidential elections, they secured less than 25% in North Gyeongsang (Gyeongbuk) and less than 40% in South Gyeongsang (Gyeongnam). But according to exit polls conducted by South Korea’s three major broadcast networks, Lee appears to have broken through these barriers, significantly improving his performance.\n\n\n\nYear\nGyeongbuk (%)\nGyeongnam (%)\n\n\n\n\n2012\n18.61\n36.33\n\n\n2016\n21.73\n36.73\n\n\n2021\n23.80\n37.38\n\n\n2025\n28.20\n43.40 (projection)\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to find any alternative explanation for this regional shift more compelling than the failed coup attempt. Though often portrayed as sympathetic to Yoon, voters in the Gyeongsang region have sent a clear and unprecedented message: they, too, reject what Yoon did and what he stood for."
