AKPS Newsletter - Spring 2025
Dear Colleagues,

Happy New Year! As we embark on this exciting new chapter, I am delighted to share highlights from my experience as an officer of AKPS in 2024, along with the remarkable opportunities that await us in 2025.

In September, during the APSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia, AKPS hosted a business meeting followed by a networking dinner, which more than thirteen members attended. Participants were updated on ongoing and new AKPS initiatives while enjoying the camaraderie of like-minded, collegial scholars. I hope in our upcoming dinners in Chicago and Vancouver even more members can partake in these enjoyable and enriching gatherings.

At the close of 2024, a group of dedicated colleagues successfully launched the third cohort of the Korean Political Studies Colloquium (KPSC). This intellectual forum provides a supportive environment for junior scholars to share their ongoing research projects. Through the tremendous efforts of the co-conveners, five sessions have been secured for Spring 2025. The fourth cohort is tentatively scheduled for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026. Please stay tuned for the upcoming Call for Proposals!

The most significant moment for AKPS in 2024 was the release of our "Statement Condemning Yoon Suk Yeol’s Unconstitutional Declaration of Martial Law in South Korea." When the foundation of Korean democracy—our shared area of study—faced a direct threat, AKPS responded decisively. Despite our longstanding policy of political neutrality, the officers and board members acted swiftly, issuing a public condemnation of the insurrection. To the best of my knowledge, this marked one of the earliest statements of its kind by a political science organization, and it reflects our collective commitment to democratic principles.

The current political landscape in South Korea points to a prolonged period of uncertainty, with various efforts to define and conceptualize critical political moments. I am confident that AKPS members will continue to provide intellectual leadership through their research and teaching in such an environment. The officers and board members are here to support you as we navigate these challenges together.

Thank you for your dedication to the study of Korean politics and democracy.

Sincerely,
Byunghwan Ben Son
Vice President
