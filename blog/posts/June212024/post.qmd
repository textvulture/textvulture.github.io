# Trump’s fund raising caught up with Biden’s

[“Trump Has Rapidly Eroded Biden’s Edge in 2024 Cash Battle”](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/us/politics/trump-fundraising-biden-election.html)

-   Trump “out-raised President Biden for the second consecutive month in May, outpacing” Biden by about \$81 mn. Just two months ago, Biden had an obvious upper hand here (by about 100mn).

-   The felony verdicts probably drove the fund raising: “The Trump campaign has said it raised \$53 million online in the first 24 hours and \$70 million in the first 48 hours after the verdict.”

-   Nonetheless, ““But at the end of the day, Biden has the funds that he needs to run a really strong campaign.””

# Central Bankers’ limits \[op-ed\]

[“Markets ignore the internal politics of central banks at their peril”](https://www.ft.com/content/4e5734d4-a0f5-4f3b-8c08-44c80e8319ce)

-   “Neither the US Federal Reserve’s Jay Powell nor the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde is a certified member of the central bankers’ club. Lacking the economics training and record, they must operate as deft chairs of technocratic boards.”

    -   Powell is a Georgetown JD (with a investment banking career); Largarde has law and English degrees (MA) from France with experiences in the law (antitrust) and bureaucracy.

-   The lack of their won expertise renders decision making ‘constrained’ by data. Even when they’d like to cut rates, for instance, the monthly inflation data readings would prevent it.

# Campus tension between Jews and Muslims

[“At Stanford, 2 Reports on Bias Show Extent of Divide Between Jews and Muslims”](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/us/stanford-antisemitism-muslims-report.html)

-   “One report documented antisemitic threats. The other, anti-Muslim threats. Both signaled that there may be little room for agreement.”

-   “The report on antisemitism — by a university subcommittee on antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, consisting of faculty, students and an alumnus — found that acts of antisemitism have ranged from an anonymous threat on social media against a student journalist who had written about antisemitism to what students said was intimidation in the classroom and residence halls.”

    -   examples: “a social media message calling for a student journalist to be “waterboarded with gas and set on fire” after he wrote an essay about antisemitism; an instructor who had told students that “only six million” Jews had died in the Holocaust, and compared it with the 12 million deaths in colonial Belgium; and mezuzahs, a religious talisman, being ripped from some students’ door frames.”

-   “The other report — by Stanford’s Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities committee — described what it called “a rupture of trust” between students, staff and faculty. “These communities have felt afraid for their safety, unseen and unheard by university leadership,” it said.”

    -   examples: “a threatening email from a Stanford alumnus to two undergraduate members of Students for Justice in Palestine with the subject line, “College Terror List — You Made It!”; a professor haranguing students at a pro-Palestinian protest, accusing them of doing “the work of Islamic jihad and Hamas”; and a printout of a Palestinian flag taken off a student’s door and ripped in half.”
