I am emotional even now, but wrote something for MSNBC about the attempted coup (or insurrection) by Yoon and his cronies. Democracy prevailed. But it came very close (*and with the information that surfaced after publishing this Op-Ed, it was even closer than I thought it was!*) and at least three core things had to go right: vigilant opposition parties, self-restraints of the military, and organized citizens.
