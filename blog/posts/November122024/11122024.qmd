The turnout in 2024 was projected to be about 65%. It's definitely lower than 2020, which was the historic 67%--but not by too much. It suggests that the election wasn't about 'too many people staying home.' This is particularly so given that the 2020 election was a special one. People were terrified of how the Pandemic would unfold while the economy was bad. Mail ballots were much easier to access. 
The turnout in 2024 seems pretty similar to 2020. The result therefore seems more a function of the retrospective voting on incumbent in an environment that favors the opposition heavily.
