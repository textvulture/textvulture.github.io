Blogging may belong to the ancient civilization. But hey, I am not exactly the young blood in town. In fact, as I get older writing–really the biggest part of my job description–is becoming increasingly hard. So hard to the point where I need some anchor. Hopefully this blog serves that purpose. So it is mostly for myself.

Here are some ground rules that I will try to adhere to, but also constantly think about change for improvement.

- I will talk about at least three but no more than five media pieces. Given my media consumption, it’s going to be most likely from NYT and FT.

- I will pay extra attention to the tags (categories), for the purpose of the ex-post organization.

- I won’t spend more than 45 minutes for this excercise. I might want to use a timer for this.
