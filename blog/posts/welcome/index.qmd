This is my first post in a Quarto blog. **Welcome!**

Blogging may belong to the ancient civilization. But hey, I am not exactly the young blood in town. In fact, as I get older writing--really the biggest part of my job description--is becoming increasingly hard. So hard to the point where I need some anchor. Hopefully this blog serves that purpose. So it is mostly for myself.
