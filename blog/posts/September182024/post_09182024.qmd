# White collar nob market mismatch

["Blanked or rejected: is finding a job harder than ever?"](https://www.ft.com/content/1429fcb2-e0ef-4e47-b2b8-8bd225ac2fe2)

-   Numerous applications (more than 100) still don't seem to lead to good results. The pandemic surge in labor demand is now gone, though unemployment rates are generally low.

    -   "Now openings are only 12 per cent above pre-pandemic levels in the US and 8 per cent below in the UK."

-   Interests rate hikes "curbed employers' ability to invest in hiring."

-   The problem, however, is that the employers are "still struggling to find quality candidates among the deluge."

    -   one reason is AI tailors CVs so good that most of them look good.

    -   anxious applicants put in more applications ("spray and pray" approach), triggering a vicious cycle. Companies also cut back hiring budgets and recruiters have a hard time reviewing all applicants.

    -   another area of mismatch is between the blue- and white-collar jobs. Demand for the former is much stronger than the latter.

# Steve Cohen

["Steve Cohen to step back from trading at hedge fund Point72"](https://www.ft.com/content/cfbe7eed-5c6c-4c4e-b717-92eea75f1f40)

-   "Steve Cohen, the billionaire founder of US hedge fund Point72, is stepping back from trading to focus on running the firm he founded a decade ago."

-   Point72 is unique, in that "\[u\]nlike a traditional hedge fund that might trade one or two strategies in one asset class, Point72 has hundreds of investment staff across 185 teams around the world, focusing on a variety of trading strategies in equities, macro and computer-driven trading."

-   One reason seems to be that Point72 became too successful and large.

# Exploding pagers

["Exploding pagers join long history of killer communications devices"](https://www.ft.com/content/dbaac693-2fd2-41bc-b5e7-6c2c7dd92277)

-   Hizbolla was hit by Israel, through explosion of pagers, a communication medium that they prefer for simplicity and intractability.

-   Israeli attack through communication devices is nothing new.

-   How exactly it was conducted this time is not entirely clear.

# Wall Street is betting on a big cut.

["Wall Street Has Its Eye on a Big Rate Cut"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/stock-market-fed-rate-cut.html)

-   *update (2:30pm):* Fed cut the rates by .5 [FT link](https://www.ft.com/content/bff9e6d8-8906-4b3d-9ff3-72b091b6cd9e)

-   S&P500 and many other stock market indices surged in the expectation of a big interest rate cut (to be determined today) by Fed.

-   Lately, there's been some changes in the expectation: "The gains have come with traders in futures markets indicating that they think a half-point cut — even if an unusually big move — is the most likely outcome on Wednesday. That’s a big shift in thinking from just a few weeks ago."

    -   But if a big cut is read by the market as a sign of a pending recession, the consequence would be dire.

        -   hence the caution: "There are some signs of caution among investors. The gains in recent weeks have been led by real estate and utilities, with the former seen as a primary beneficiary of lower rates and the latter a more defensive bet as the economy slows. The technology stocks that led the market rally for so many years have slipped over the past month."
