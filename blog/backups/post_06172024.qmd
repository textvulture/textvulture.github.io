# China, UK, and Spies

[“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”](https://www.ft.com/content/11272883-8a52-4730-9842-666c886ba8b8)

- The UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.

- The concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.

# Sanctions and Consequences
[“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”](https://www.ft.com/content/d55f9e63-a49d-47f5-967c-6a5730c67ded)

- Israeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”

  - “Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”
  
- He is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.

- Cobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.

- His first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.

- “In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)

- “Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”

- NK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks.
