In fact, as I get older writing–really the biggest part of my job description–is becoming increasingly hard. So hard to the point where I need some anchor. Hopefully this blog serves that purpose. So it is mostly for myself."

    "text": "French Election, not the time to panic?\n“ECB chief economist plays down need to intervene in French bond market”\n\nECB says it won’t buy French bonds “after the announcement of a snap French parliamentary election caused a sell-off in the country’s debt.”\nBut the French budget situation has been less-than-ideal recently.\n\n\n\n\nECB granted itself the power to buy unlimited amount of a Eurozone country’s bods in 2022, but this has not been activated.\n“France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned last week that a victory by the RN could lead to a “debt crisis” similar to the market chaos fuelled by former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s mini-budget in 2022.”\n\n\n\nFighting Disinformation through Subscription\n“Austrian left pledges free newspaper access for young readers”\n\n“Austria’s opposition social democrats have promised to fund newspaper subscriptions for people under 30, in a bid to combat disinformation and what they say is the “Orbanisation” of Austrian politics.”\nThe contents themselves wouldn’t be restricted, but which outlet qualifies will be determined.\nBackground: “The far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) is supported by 29 per cent of Austrians — and won the European parliament vote earlier this month — but because of its toxicity it may struggle to find junior coalition partners for a cabinet led by FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl.” And young people are key to the success of the far-right outlets’ growth.\nThe fund will likely support about half of a typical news subscrption fee, which the critiques argue to be the reason why the plan wouldn’t be successful.\n\n\n\nUS cities struggle as migrants come in\n“More Cities Feel Strain as Migrants Move In Seeking Better Prospects”\n\nThe aid money is running out (e.g., hotel stay for the migrants)\nWhile the bordercrossing has declined recerntly, “an untold number” of migrants are currently ont he move around US cities trying to find an opportunity.\nTo obtain work permits, applying for asylum is necessary, but the process takes a long time (and a lawyer), 150 days, typically.\n\n\n\nAnd this is perhaps the most concise explanation for QE.\n\nsource: FT, “Central Banks”. By Chris Giles\n“Why do QE losses arise?\nQuantitative easing is the process whereby a central bank creates money and buys assets. The vast majority of money created globally has bought government bonds from outside the banking system. In doing so, the central bank earns the coupon from the bond it has purchased and the money used to purchase the bonds end up as private deposits in commercial banks. These banks have an excess of these deposits and park them overnight at the central bank where they are remunerated at the policy rate. \nWhen interest rates are low or zero, the coupons exceed the overnight interest rate and the central bank makes a profit, which is generally passed back to government. But if interest rates rise, as they have, the overnight rate exceeds the return on assets, generating a net interest loss (or negative carry). In addition, as interest rates rise, the value of the bond falls and when it is redeemed, it is generally worth less than the amount that was paid, although this depends on the coupon on the bond and the price paid. \nSo, as interest rates rise, central banks tend to make both a net interest loss and capital loss on redemption.”"

    "text": "Naval Drones in Ukraine\n“Ukraine’s naval drone success holds a huge lesson for the U.S. Navy”\n\n“Without a standing navy of its own, Ukraine has disabled at least one-third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.”\nAnti-ship cruise missiles helped, but “Ukraine has also innovated brilliantly by developing its own unmanned surface vessels, which can hunt Russian warships in wolf packs.”\nUnmanned speed boats, only a few hundred thousand dollars, are sinking multi-million dollar warships, a story that has big implications for the inter-strait relationship. The drone technology gives advantage to defenders.\nJust like it was for battleships in WWII, carriers are now seem to be at the twilight of their days.\nThe US navy not entirely invested into the game perhaps due to the military contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats and Congress.\n\n\n\nAreas of importance for South Africa’s New Government\n“As President Takes Oath, 4 Challenges for South Africa’s New Government”\n\n\nANC got only 40% of the vote, resulting in a divided government. The second largest party, the Democratic Alliance that has been a staunch opponent to ANC, won 22%.\nBut ANC is not very much willing to share the power (i.e., sharing cabinet posts with other parties).\nThe economy is in a bad shape and the country is moving to the direction of privatization and deregulation. Both the incumbent president and Democratic Alliance in agreement seem to be in agreement on this.\nRacial disparity (e.g., land ownership) is the biggest issue of contention between ANC and DA.\nForeign policy: ANC has “agitated” the West but DA is more west-leaning.\n\n\n\nEconomic Consequences of the French electoral Result.\n“What would a far-right or leftwing government mean for France’s economy?”\n\nBoth far-right (RN) and hard-left (New Popular Front, NFP) parties of Francce are fiscal populists.\nThe far right:\n\npromises of easing the cost of living crisis (e.g., tax cuts on energy), implications for which are big fiscal holes.\npromises of the French contribution to the EU (which would be retaliated by not receiving the funding from the EU); reversing the pension reform\npromises of ending some tax cuts to fill the hole (but estimated too small in scale)\n\nThe hard-left:\n\na radical tax-and-spend plan (costing more than 100 bn euros)\nwage increase; reversing the pension reform\npromises of ‘squeezing the rich (and corporations)’ to fund the program (but the tax rates in France is already quite high)\n\n“The left would cause capital flight and the far right would cause a debt crisis.”\n\n\n\nRush to Indian Bonds as an alternative\n“JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds”\n\n\n“India’s $1.3 trillion in sovereign debt as fixed-income investors seek an alternative to Russia and China”\n“On June 28, JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to add Indian government debt to its biggest emerging-market bond index” and Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. and FTSE Russell are following the suit.\nPerhaps as a result, “In June, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a high, and the rupee has been the best-performing currency in emerging Asia against the dollar in 2024 even as the US currency has strengthened globally.”\nThe reason? “With China facing economic challenges, Russia isolated because of its invasion of Ukraine and no other obvious candidate poised to supplant them, India’s robust economic expansion has made it a top choice for investors seeking diversification” and the electoral setback that Modi suffered doesn’t seem to have much influence here."

    "text": "Russia-NK, a told-you-so moment\n“Russia and North Korea’s Defense Pact Is a Told-You-So Moment in Asia”\n\nthe Cold War-era mutual defense agreement: “if one country found itself in a state of war, then the other would provide “military and other assistance with all means in its possession without delay””\n“the meeting between the two authoritarian leaders, both desperate for outside support, provided a bit of an I-told-you-so moment for the United States and its Asian allies, who have been preparing in recent years for growing security challenges from North Korea as well as China, and sometimes have faced domestic political headwinds for doing so.”\nWhat seems obvious is that Seoul doesn’t have any leverage over North Korea, let alone Russia. Tokyo, on the other hand, has maintained a certain degree of cooperation with NK, or at least some possibilities of it. So there’s a nuanced difference between South Korea and Japan in their strategic position with regard to North Korea.\n\n\n\nThe Russia-NK treaty is a headache to China\n“Russia and North Korea’s Defense Pact Is a New Headache for China”\n\nthe pact between NK and Russia “[appears] to deepen the semblance of a trilateral axis between China, Russia and North Korea, which China has sought to avoid. “Beijing has very carefully stayed away from the optics of a China-Russia-North Korea axis,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington. “It wants to keep its options open.””\n“China has sought to distance itself from the new pact, with a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry on Thursday declining to comment.”\n\n\n\nRussian Nuclear Reactors as a vehicle of influence\n“How Russia is using nuclear power to win global influence”\n\n“Despite sanctions, Russian companies are building more than a third of the new reactors around the world, which is gaining Moscow new friends.”\n\n“Sanctions have so far not hampered the nuclear energy sector, which can create long-lasting political ties and disrupt western efforts to isolate Putin’s regime.” Important to note, however, Russia already accounted for about half of all international nuclear power plant deals.\n\nWestern governments try to curb this trend of dominance, but there’s a long-term commitment issue. “Nuclear plant construction takes about 10 years, with a reactor lifespan of 60 years for newer plants. Dismantling preparations, including removing radioactive parts, take another 10-20 years and require substantial funds.” So when countries host Russian reactors, quite a bit of commitment was there already.\nRosatom, Russian nuclear reactor company, is instrumental for Russian government to court the political support from the global south.\nBut, Russia treats the reactors as if owned by Russian companies and require the host government to only buy the electricity from the reactor.\n“State-owned Rosatom is able to offer up to 90 per cent financing for nuclear projects, with repayments spread over decades at minimal interest rates,” which is attractive to credit-poor developing countries."
