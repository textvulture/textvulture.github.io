    "text": "This is my first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nBlogging may belong to the ancient civilization. But hey, I am not exactly the young blood in town. In fact, as I get older writing–really the biggest part of my job description–is becoming increasingly hard. So hard to the point where I need some anchor. Hopefully this blog serves that purpose. So it is mostly for myself.\nHere are some ground rules that I will try to adhere to, but also constantly think about change for improvement.\nFirst, I will talk about at least three but no more than five media pieces. Given my media consumption, it’s going to be most likely from NYT and FT.\nSecond, I will pay extra attention to the tags (categories), for the purpose of the ex-post organization.\nThird, I won’t spend more than 45 minutes for this excercise. I might want to use a timer for this."

    "text": "The collapse of public support for the Tories\n“How Support for Britain’s Conservative Party is Collapsing”\n\n\n\n“voter moves”\n\n\n\nFewer than half of the former Tory voters are sticking with the party in the upcoming election. BREXIT, once a salient issue, is not as important any more. The economy (Liz Truss), health (longer waiting time for ‘elected care’), and immigration (consistently increased under the conservative rule) are more important than before.\nLabor is not in an overwhelmingly better position as they are forecast to lose some young voters (allegedly due to the their center-turn). Labor needs a comprehensive and substantial victory to win back the power. Their numbers hadn’t been quite there until recently, but they are improving now.\n\nThis nuanced point might be a bit too nuanced. The polls actually predict a complete wipeout of the Tories and an unprecedented victory for the Labor. For example: \n\n“One key test for Labour will be whether it can win back postindustrial heartlands in the Midlands and north of England, traditionally known as the “red wall.””\nThe Reform Party led by Farage could be a threat to the Conservative: “Unlike the Liberal Democrats, Reform’s voter base is spread thinly across the country, and, while that makes it difficult to win seats, it could split the right-wing vote across the country and cause the Conservatives to lose more seats to Labour.”\n\n\n\nChinese tech companies squeeze their workers for extended hours as their growth slows down\n“‘We’re like gears grinding until they break’: Chinese tech companies push staff to the limit”\n\nThe working conditions for the Chinese tech workers were traditionally bad. “But the unremitting schedule has improved in recent years under President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” campaign, which aims to reduce income inequality and promote fairness.” But as the growth of the sector slows down, they are going back to the “leaner and meaner start-up days.”\n“To boost their own efficiency, industry pillars Alibaba and Tencent have shed tens of thousands of staff since 2021.” The older workers are particularly in peril as their job market prospects are not great and the chances of redundancy high. Companies are searching for ‘young and unmarried’ workers.\nThe tech sector is considered the most coveted one among young Chinese, nonetheless because of its high pay.\nThere are some movements against the ‘996’ (9-to-9 for 6 days). “In 2021, with President Xi cracking down on personalities such as Ma, China’s supreme court declared the 996 schedule illegal. The victory did not come without costs. Authorities detained three labour activists involved in the campaign and sentenced them to prison terms of two to five years.”\n\n\n\nIn UCSF, doctors feud over Gaza given the ‘do no harm’ principle.\n“In San Francisco, Doctors Feud Over ‘Do No Harm’ When It Comes to War Protests”\n\n“People are coming here for chemotherapy. They have dire illnesses,” Dr. Terdiman said. “When that chant goes up and is heard in the patient care rooms, which it clearly was, it’s a violation of our professional obligations as health care providers.”\n“U.C.S.F. has a dress code prohibiting political symbols in patient care settings, but Dr. Ghannam said staff members for years have worn pins supporting abortion rights, Black Lives Matter and the L.G.B.T.Q. community without repercussions.”"

    "text": "China, UK, and Spies\n“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”\n\nThe UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.\nThe concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.\n\n\n\nSanctions and Consequences\n“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”\n\nIsraeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\n“Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”\n\nHe is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."
