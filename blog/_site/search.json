    "text": "Naval Drones in Ukraine\n“Ukraine’s naval drone success holds a huge lesson for the U.S. Navy”\n\n“Without a standing navy of its own, Ukraine has disabled at least one-third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.”\nAnti-ship cruise missiles helped, but “Ukraine has also innovated brilliantly by developing its own unmanned surface vessels, which can hunt Russian warships in wolf packs.”\nUnmanned speed boats, only a few hundred thousand dollars, are sinking multi-million dollar warships, a story that has big implications for the inter-strait relationship. The drone technology gives advantage to defenders.\nJust like it was for battleships in WWII, carriers are now seem to be at the twilight of their days.\nThe US navy not entirely invested into the game perhaps due to the military contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats and Congress.\n\n\n\nAreas of importance for South Africa’s New Government\n“As President Takes Oath, 4 Challenges for South Africa’s New Government”\n\n\nANC got only 40% of the vote, resulting in a divided government. The second largest party, the Democratic Alliance that has been a staunch opponent to ANC, won 22%.\nBut ANC is not very much willing to share the power (i.e., sharing cabinet posts with other parties).\nThe economy is in a bad shape and the country is moving to the direction of privatization and deregulation. Both the incumbent president and Democratic Alliance in agreement seem to be in agreement on this.\nRacial disparity (e.g., land ownership) is the biggest issue of contention between ANC and DA.\nForeign policy: ANC has “agitated” the West but DA is more west-leaning.\n\n\n\nEconomic Consequences of the French electoral Result.\n“What would a far-right or leftwing government mean for France’s economy?”\n\nBoth far-right (RN) and hard-left (New Popular Front, NFP) parties of Francce are fiscal populists.\nThe far right:\n\npromises of easing the cost of living crisis (e.g., tax cuts on energy), implications for which are big fiscal holes.\npromises of the French contribution to the EU (which would be retaliated by not receiving the funding from the EU); reversing the pension reform\npromises of ending some tax cuts to fill the hole (but estimated too small in scale)\n\nThe hard-left:\n\na radical tax-and-spend plan (costing more than 100 bn euros)\nwage increase; reversing the pension reform\npromises of ‘squeezing the rich (and corporations)’ to fund the program (but the tax rates in France is already quite high)\n\n“The left would cause capital flight and the far right would cause a debt crisis.”\n\n\n\nRush to Indian Bonds as an alternative\n“JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds”\n\n“India’s $1.3 trillion in sovereign debt as fixed-income investors seek an alternative to Russia and China”\n“On June 28, JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to add Indian government debt to its biggest emerging-market bond index” and Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. and FTSE Russell are following the suit.\nPerhaps as a result, “In June, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a high, and the rupee has been the best-performing currency in emerging Asia against the dollar in 2024 even as the US currency has strengthened globally.”\nThe reason? “With China facing economic challenges, Russia isolated because of its invasion of Ukraine and no other obvious candidate poised to supplant them, India’s robust economic expansion has made it a top choice for investors seeking diversification” and the electoral setback that Modi suffered doesn’t seem to have much influence here."

    "text": "China, UK, and Spies\n“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”\n\nThe UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.\nThe concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.\n\n\n\nSanctions and Consequences\n“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”\n\nIsraeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\n“Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”\n\nHe is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Trump’s fund raising caught up with Biden’s\n“Trump Has Rapidly Eroded Biden’s Edge in 2024 Cash Battle”\n\nTrump “out-raised President Biden for the second consecutive month in May, outpacing” Biden by about $81 mn. Just two months ago, Biden had an obvious upper hand here (by about 100mn).\nThe felony verdicts probably drove the fund raising: “The Trump campaign has said it raised $53 million online in the first 24 hours and $70 million in the first 48 hours after the verdict.”\nNonetheless, ““But at the end of the day, Biden has the funds that he needs to run a really strong campaign.””\n\na related news article: “US banking heir gave Trump campaign fund $50mn after ex-president’s conviction”\nan opinion piece related to this: “Business leaders’ myopic reversal on Donald Trump”\n\n\n\n\nCentral Bankers’ limits [op-ed]\n“Markets ignore the internal politics of central banks at their peril”\n\n\n“Neither the US Federal Reserve’s Jay Powell nor the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde is a certified member of the central bankers’ club. Lacking the economics training and record, they must operate as deft chairs of technocratic boards.”\n\nPowell is a Georgetown JD (with a investment banking career); Largarde has law and English degrees (MA) from France with experiences in the law (antitrust) and bureaucracy.\n\nThe lack of their won expertise renders decision making ‘constrained’ by data. Even when they’d like to cut rates, for instance, the monthly inflation data readings would prevent it.\n\n\n\nCampus tension between Jews and Muslims\n“At Stanford, 2 Reports on Bias Show Extent of Divide Between Jews and Muslims”\n\n“One report documented antisemitic threats. The other, anti-Muslim threats. Both signaled that there may be little room for agreement.”\n“The report on antisemitism — by a university subcommittee on antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, consisting of faculty, students and an alumnus — found that acts of antisemitism have ranged from an anonymous threat on social media against a student journalist who had written about antisemitism to what students said was intimidation in the classroom and residence halls.”\n\nexamples: “a social media message calling for a student journalist to be “waterboarded with gas and set on fire” after he wrote an essay about antisemitism; an instructor who had told students that “only six million” Jews had died in the Holocaust, and compared it with the 12 million deaths in colonial Belgium; and mezuzahs, a religious talisman, being ripped from some students’ door frames.”\n\n“The other report — by Stanford’s Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities committee — described what it called “a rupture of trust” between students, staff and faculty. “These communities have felt afraid for their safety, unseen and unheard by university leadership,” it said.”\n\nexamples: “a threatening email from a Stanford alumnus to two undergraduate members of Students for Justice in Palestine with the subject line, “College Terror List — You Made It!”; a professor haranguing students at a pro-Palestinian protest, accusing them of doing “the work of Islamic jihad and Hamas”; and a printout of a Palestinian flag taken off a student’s door and ripped in half.”"

Those skills should serve him well in an alliance that works by consensus, where one country can block the intentions of the rest.”\n“Under Mr. Rutte, the Netherlands has increased military spending to more than the 2 percent of gross domestic product demanded of NATO members, and it has provided F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv while investing more in its own military.”\n\n\n\nSovereign debt restructuring is getting better\n“Sovereign Debt Restructuring Process Is Improving Amid Cooperation and Reform”\n\n\nThe Common Framework “started to deliver.”\n\nmade possible partly because “because stakeholders have developed more experience working together, including with non-traditional official creditors like China, India, and Saudi Arabia.”\n\noutside CF, the pace is getting faster too.\n“The IMF, World Bank and the Presidency of the Group of Twenty introduced the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) early last year to help overcome various disagreements on technical issues.

The process was slow and expensive with many middlemen in between. Chinese groups offer the service at a much cheaper commission, effectively pushing out all competitors.\n\nThe primary way of laundering: ‘mirror transfers’ using Chinese bank accounts that are practically invisible to US authorities.\n\nCartels drop off USD cash to Chinese launders, who pay the cartels directly in the peso in Mexico.

This includes “the far-left La France Insoumise, led by anti-capitalist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon.” Broken down into the party-level, though, the biggest party is the far right France Unbowed with 74 seats. The Socialists, 59.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, major cabinet members, including the prime minister, are asked to remain in their posts.\n\nThe government forming remains a difficult task. The far-left block, for example, is a hard sell to macron: “But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with Mélenchon. Speaking after last Sunday’s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal – Macron’s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a “credible alternative” to the far right.” CNN article\n\nThe left seem to deal with some internal tensions, which is reflected in the comments like: “Mathilde Panot, a high-level figure in Mélenchon’s party, told RTL radio on Monday that the veteran leftwinger was “absolutely not disqualified” for the prime minister job.”\n\n\n\nResurging Investment Banking\n“Dealmaking revival expected to boost results for Wall Street banks”\n\nInvestment banking fee recovery is expected to boost lenders.\n\nInvestment banking revenues at “JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup will on average rise more than 30 per cent from a year earlier during the second quarter.”\nSome examples of the resurgence of deal-making: “ExxonMobil’s $60bn acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, which was brokered by Citigroup, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and Aon’s $13bn purchase of insurance broker NFP in April, which was guided by Citi and BofA, among others.”\n\nThe background is that the investment banking revenues had fallen in 2023 from record highs in 2021. The interest rates are to blame. For that reason, though, the current resurgence may fall short of reaching the 2021 level because the peak was made possible through the low interest rates and Covid stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the reflection of the private equity funds’ activities?\n\n\n\n\nThe disappointing economic effect of AI (revolution)\nWhat happened to the artificial-intelligence revolution?\n\n“[F]or ai to fulfil its potential, firms everywhere need to buy the technology, shape it to their needs and become more productive as a result.”\n\nMost ‘say’ they use AI in their business, but often for marginal tasks. More over, the surveys on this subjects remain limited to a few very slective companies. “[T]he incorporation of ai into business processes remains a niche pursuit.”\nIn surveys on a more representative sample, a single-digit percentage of respondents say they us AI for business purposes.\n\nThe obstacles? “Concerns about data security, biased algorithms and hallucinations are slowing the roll-out.”\nMost important, the AI use does not seem to have impacts in the economic outputs, reflected in the labor market.\n\n“there is no sign in the macroeconomic data of a surge in lay-offs.” (but one needs to consider that the labor market is currently very strong.)\nWorkers are not moving between companies faster than usual, either. (All these numbers are focused on white-collar jobs. But AI may more quickly replace blue-color jobs?)\nThere doesn’t seem to be any surge in productivity or capital investment either.\n\nMust of what is suggested here is looking at the very last node of the AI revolution and its impact on the economy. So a bit too early to declare the lack of signs?"

The deal was controversial as it generated about $ 17bn loss around the world. Local politicians weren’t happy with it either (“UBS was handed the “deal of the century” at the expense of the Swiss people”).\n\nThe subjects over which the two party publicly quarrel are various: e.g., executive pay; capital requirements. The latter created frictions as some believe that the failures of the Credit Suisse weren’t due to the lack fo capital.\n\nBut “[m]uch of the recent disagreement centres around plans to bolster the country’s financial system after the body blow of losing its second-biggest bank, in a public spat playing out between a group of newly hired leaders.”\n\n\n\n\nUK foreign policy under a Labour government\n(“What does Labour’s win mean for British foreign policy?”)[https://www-economist-com.mutex.gmu.edu/britain/2024/07/09/what-does-labours-win-mean-for-british-foreign-policy]\n\nthe expectation is that Sr. Keir Starmer wants to portray the UK differently than before: “Almost overnight an exaggerated image of Britain as a chaotic clown-show—true under Boris Johnson, a bit less so for Rishi Sunak—has flipped to an idealised image of stable government led by a serious-minded centrist.”\n\nMuch of the foreign policy fundamentals though will remain unchanged. Unlike, Corbyn, for example, the commitment to NATO is strong.\n“As for China, Labour has promised a full audit of its relationship with the country” and some incoming cabinet members made some hawkish remarks. But, in reality, things will remain pretty much the same, which is “to maintain openness towards consumer-goods trade” while “taking a sceptical view of Chinese investment in nuclear, telecoms and other sensitive areas.”\n\nThe discontinuity will be on the relationship with the EU, which is expected to improve (though the party has ruled out rejoining the EU).\n\nA security-and-defence cooperation agreement is a possibility."

The actions includes (but are not limited to):\n\nwriting a WaPo column (“The brave”) upon the request from her ‘handler’ in DC (and perhaps another op-ed in Foreign Affairs much earlier)\npassing notes after non-public meeting with the State Department (including Blinken)\nreceiving monetary compensations including luxury bags\n\nThe indictment indicates that there have been three ‘handlers’ in Korean embassy, all of which were NIS (National Intelligence Service of RoK) agents. The operation seems to have started in 2013, two years after she left CIA.\nThere’s no hard evidence indicating differing patterns of the operation between different admins, but it seems that during the Moon presidency, the NIS agents were seeking intelligence through Terry, while in Park and Yoon governments, what was asked for seems to be more of cheer-leading.\nGiven the inconsistency between the foreign policy orientations of the Moon government and Terry, what this incident implies is that NIS could have been pursuing its own missions, independent of the government, when it comes to the NK matters.\n\nAnother possibility, provided that Terry, who was a NK specialist and not necessarily a high-profile foreign policy person in DC, might not have had whole a lot of critical information to offer to begin with, is that the NIS handler was desperate for any intel to ‘brag about’ so as to justify their and their operation’s existence. If this is the case, it would be quite disappointing, not only because it reflects the Korean bureaucratic manerism creeping over the most important policy realm but also because it reveals that a high-ranking national intelligent officer does not have a direct contact with the State department people and instead has to rely on a third-party former-CIA analyst. Itis pretty sad. So much for the ironclad alliance.\n\nProbably a huge blow to the DC think-tank communities on Korea.\nwhy did they love sushi restaurants so much?\n\n\n\nMarket reaction to Trump: treasury boand\n“Investors revive ‘Trump trade’ in bet on US bonds”\n\n“The growing prospect of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election in November has helped revive a popular hedge fund bet on Treasury yields”\nThe market is betting on the short-term treasury bonds as Trump’s “tax-cutting and pro-trade tariff agenda could eventually lead to higher inflation and a greater supply of longer-dated government bonds.” The expectation is that the long-term bonds would outperform the short-term bonds.\n\n\n\n“[T]he bet — known in industry jargon as a “steepener” because of the expected move in the yield curve — has paid off, with the two-year yield falling by roughly double the drop in the 10-year. Prices move inversely to yields.”"

    "text": "Harris rising fast, out-raising funds against Trump\n“Harris Seizes Control, Clearing Field, Raising Cash and Slamming Trump”\n\nJust in 24 hours after Biden announced that he steps aside endorsing Kamala Harris, vice president is rapidly clearing the path towards the party’s nominee.\n\nCampaign Donations: “The Harris campaign announced on Monday that it had raised $81 million in her first 24 hours, a record sum, from 888,000 unique contributors.”; “The leading pro-Biden super PAC, Future Forward, which has become a pro-Harris operation, said that it had unlocked $150 million in the last day with $60 million in new pledges, plus $90 million that had previously been frozen while Mr. Biden’s fate hung in the balance.”\n\nThe next step on the process: “on Wednesday, when the rules committee of the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to meet to set a date for a virtual roll-call vote of the state delegations.”\n“A survey by The Associated Press showed she had more than half the support she needed, with the backing of 1,350 of the 1,976 delegates she needs.”; Top Dems, excluding Schummer and Jefferies, promptly endorsed Harris.\n\nWhile the media try to read too much into the lack of outright endorsement from Schummer-Jefferies, it is only natural that the official head of the party at the two chambers try to appear neutral. It might counter, though perhaps only marginally, the narrative that Harris clinching the nomination without an open primary is undemocratic. The prudence might also counter the long-standing conspiracy theory of the far right.\n\n\n\n\nTough US Job Market\n“US graduates face cut-throat job market as companies scrap internships”\n\nmajor companies in US are cutting internships: “Goldman Sachs hired 200 fewer summer analysts this year than in 2023. JPMorgan reduced the size of its own class of summer analysts by 600, more than ten per cent of the total. Tesla rescinded its internship offers just weeks before students were due to start.”\nZipRecruiter says that the year-to-year difference is negative 14 percent. The “traditional, white-colllar” jobs are particularly getting cut.\nMuch less enthusiasm: “Sean McGowan, director of employer relations at Carnegie Mellon University, said companies had this year taken months longer than normal to commit to attending his college’s hiring fairs for summer internships. Those that did come relied more heavily on virtual interviews, instead of flying out recruiters to meet students.”\nThe trend made the competition more intense: “Goldman Sachs received 315,000 applications for fewer than 3,000 roles. JPMorgan received 493,000 applications, an 82 per cent increase from last summer.”\n\n\n\nChina ramping up the pressure on the new Taiwanese president\n“Taiwan’s Blunt-Talking Leader Faces China’s Backlash”\n\nLai Ching-te’s campaign promise was to maintain Tsai Ing-wen’s China policy which was to avoid confrontations. The policy itself might not have changed, but his speeches on China became much “blunter.”\nThe “officials in Beijing seemed taken aback by how starkly he drew a line between Taiwan and China in his high-profile May inauguration speech,” in which he stated that “dialogue with Beijing is only possible if the two sides negotiate as separate equals, not … based on the idea that each side accepts that it is part of one Chinese nation.”\n\nTaiwanese leaders emphasizing equality is not new; but doing so in the inauguration speech, given its symbolic importance, is new.\n\nBeijing has attempted some military forays into Taiwan’s aerial and maritime territories but is worried that such pressures are not resulting in the desired effect.\n\nBeijing released a new ‘guideline’ furthering and detailing the ‘illegality’ of independence movement. Taiwanese authority warned their citizens about traveling to China. Mr. Lai, in response, wrote in the social media that “Democracy is not a crime; autocracy is what’s truly malicious.”"

    "text": "Anti-Tourism in (Southern) Europe\n“The cost of Europe’s backlash against tourists”\n\n“European countries hosted 709mn international visitors last year, with rising numbers coming from North America but the vast majority travelling within Europe.”\n\nSpain’s “tourist promotion agency predicts that visitor numbers from June to September will be up 13 per cent from a year ago.”\nThe growth in the number of tourists has been so dramatic that the locals have “snapped.”\nsnapshot: “Spaniards remain agog at drunk Britons engaged in “balconing”, the life-threatening activity of clambering between balconies or leaping from them into a pool.”\n\nMass protests in sizes like 10,000 or 5,000 took place recently. Things are gentrified, prices hiked, and local expelled.\nHowever, “rejecting a sector that is the economic lifeblood of many places is dangerous.”\nThe sequence:\n\nFueled by influencers, tourists swarming for ‘authenticity’ reaching deep local areas. Tourism income dominates the local economy.\nDue to Covid-19, local authorities racked up a lot of debts.\nWhen tourists came back in the post-pandemic, authorities were desperate to welcome them back, which led to lax regulations.\n\nWhile governments are employing many measures to suppress over-tourism, one thing that locals are most interested is housing. Lisbon and Barcelona are restricting commercial renting, against which property owners made legal challenges.\n\n\n\n2-year Treasury bond in the record demand\n“Auction of 2-year Treasury notes shows record demand levels”\n\nshort story: traders expect an interest cut soon and want to lock in a high-rate bond before it.\n\n\n\nModi plans a spending plan for his allies\n“India unveils spending binge to boost Narendra Modi’s allies”\n\nAfter the shocking electoral setback (losing the absolute majority), Modi “has announced a spending splurge for its new coalition partners.”\n\nspending packages for regional coalition partners: “This included a Rs260bn industrial corridor running through Bihar, Rs150bn for a new “high-tech” capital in Andhra Pradesh called Amaravati and funds for flood reconstruction and developing local temples.”\n\nThe plan also entails keeping capital investment high while cutting fiscal deficits. Youth joblessness is considered one of the reasons for the electoral setback."

    "text": "private equlity generates so much debt, which is a global threat\n“How private equity tangled banks in a web of debt”\n\n\nPrivate equity grew through the low-interest environment, which enabled them to purchase firms easily. In the process, banks constructed multiple connections with the actors of PEFs such as “ending to buyout-owned companies, the funds that acquire them, the firms that manage them and the investors that back them.”\n\ninterest rate hikes can upend all this, posing essentially a big risk to banks.\n\nSo how does a PEF operates (to by companies), ending up affecting banks?\n\nAt the beginning, a PE firm will launch a fund with partners (executives), who are “responsible for managing the fund.” Limited partners (outside investors) might pitch in some cash too. These partners may borrow from banks “to finance their commitment to the fund.” This borrowing may generate collateral, which are the partners’ “existing stakes in other funds.”\n\n\nIn return, a general partner gets paid of a fee (for managing the fund) “as well as a share of the profits from successful investments.”\n\n\nWhat amounted to the borrowing that reaches $900 bn in 2023 is the subscription line: “short-term financing used to acquire companies before cash from limited partners is tapped.” The money from limited partners is used as security for a subscription line. But a subscription line plays only a partial role\nThe primary resource to complete a company-buying deal is simply debt financing (borrowing) from banks. The cash generated by the business of the bought company is used to pay off this debt. This debt might be sold to others, but the bank has to hold on to it if the demand is weak.\nPEFs will repeat the process of 1-3 and end up owning multiple companies (or a portfolio of companies). Using these companies as collateral, the fund can also borrow&lt;&gt; directly from banks. Such money can either bail out a struggling company (which is a ‘leverage on leverage’) or fund a payout to investors (net asset value financing: $100 bn in 2023). Overall a high-leverage structure.\n‘Secondaries funds’ can buy stakes from limited partners. For a bit of discounts, this gives limited partners some cash upfront. The secondaries may also borrow from the bank to finance this.\nIndividual companies (owned by PEFs) may also borrow directly from bank to boost returns for investors. (this borrowing reached $30 bn in 2024)\n‘General partner stakes funds’ can buy the funds’ stake directly from general partners. To fund this purchase, they may also borrow&gt; from banks.\n\nSome big examples of this kind of buyout model: Caesars Entertainment (casino); Alliance Boots (pharma chain)\nsome big PE firms specialized in this kind of processes (secondaries fund): Blackstone, Ardian. Other financial actors buy shares of this kind of PF firms.\nIn a high interest rate environment, all these borrowings add up. And partners seek more liquidity upon growing pressure, initiating a negative spiral.\n‘Private credit funds’ also have been lending just like banks. They have much less transparency or liquidity than banks. But because they are lending to the same actors/actions as the banks do, a shock emanating from the private credit market will shake banks.\n\n\n\nTech stocks sink.\n“Global tech stocks sink as sell-off spreads to Europe and Asia”\n\n“Global tech stocks sank on Thursday as a Wall Street sell-off spread to Europe and Asia.”; “The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent after the opening bell on Wall Street, extending its recent slump following the worst day in 18 months.”\nChipmakers (Nvidia and Arm Holdings) led the downward trend. Disappoint earnings reports and geopolitical tensions are said to be the culprits. German, Japanese (particularly dramatic), and South Korean chipmakers stocks also showed similar patterns."

    "text": "Mark Kelly as VP?\n“Spaceman, Senator, V.P. Pick? Kamala Harris Sizes Up Mark Kelly.”\n\nAZ Sen. Mark Kelly has an impressive resume: “He is the working-class son of New Jersey police officers, a Navy pilot who flew 39 combat missions off the U.S.S. Midway in Operation Desert Storm, and a NASA astronaut and engineer who collected debris from the Columbia disaster, commanded a shuttle as the United States returned to space and flew the Space Shuttle Endeavour’s final mission” and “is married to Gabrielle Giffords.” He bonded with McCain, an important figure to remember in AZ and gained respect from AZ Republicans.\nBut the real strength is on the border issue. “Mr. Kelly’s approach to the border embraces barriers like Mr. Trump’s wall in some places, though not across the entire frontier. He has also called for an immigration policy that treats migrants with respect and maintains asylum options.”"
