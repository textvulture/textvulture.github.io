    "text": "Naval Drones in Ukraine\n“Ukraine’s naval drone success holds a huge lesson for the U.S. Navy”\n\n“Without a standing navy of its own, Ukraine has disabled at least one-third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.”\nAnti-ship cruise missiles helped, but “Ukraine has also innovated brilliantly by developing its own unmanned surface vessels, which can hunt Russian warships in wolf packs.”\nUnmanned speed boats, only a few hundred thousand dollars, are sinking multi-million dollar warships, a story that has big implications for the inter-strait relationship. The drone technology gives advantage to defenders.\nJust like it was for battleships in WWII, carriers are now seem to be at the twilight of their days.\nThe US navy not entirely invested into the game perhaps due to the military contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats and Congress.\n\n\n\nAreas of importance for South Africa’s New Government\n“As President Takes Oath, 4 Challenges for South Africa’s New Government”\n\n\nANC got only 40% of the vote, resulting in a divided government. The second largest party, the Democratic Alliance that has been a staunch opponent to ANC, won 22%.\nBut ANC is not very much willing to share the power (i.e., sharing cabinet posts with other parties).\nThe economy is in a bad shape and the country is moving to the direction of privatization and deregulation. Both the incumbent president and Democratic Alliance in agreement seem to be in agreement on this.\nRacial disparity (e.g., land ownership) is the biggest issue of contention between ANC and DA.\nForeign policy: ANC has “agitated” the West but DA is more west-leaning.\n\n\n\nEconomic Consequences of the French electoral Result.\n“What would a far-right or leftwing government mean for France’s economy?”\n\nBoth far-right (RN) and hard-left (New Popular Front, NFP) parties of Francce are fiscal populists.\nThe far right:\n\npromises of easing the cost of living crisis (e.g., tax cuts on energy), implications for which are big fiscal holes.\npromises of the French contribution to the EU (which would be retaliated by not receiving the funding from the EU); reversing the pension reform\npromises of ending some tax cuts to fill the hole (but estimated too small in scale)\n\nThe hard-left:\n\na radical tax-and-spend plan (costing more than 100 bn euros)\nwage increase; reversing the pension reform\npromises of ‘squeezing the rich (and corporations)’ to fund the program (but the tax rates in France is already quite high)\n\n“The left would cause capital flight and the far right would cause a debt crisis.”\n\n\n\nRush to Indian Bonds as an alternative\n“JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds”\n\n“India’s $1.3 trillion in sovereign debt as fixed-income investors seek an alternative to Russia and China”\n“On June 28, JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to add Indian government debt to its biggest emerging-market bond index” and Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. and FTSE Russell are following the suit.\nPerhaps as a result, “In June, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a high, and the rupee has been the best-performing currency in emerging Asia against the dollar in 2024 even as the US currency has strengthened globally.”\nThe reason? “With China facing economic challenges, Russia isolated because of its invasion of Ukraine and no other obvious candidate poised to supplant them, India’s robust economic expansion has made it a top choice for investors seeking diversification” and the electoral setback that Modi suffered doesn’t seem to have much influence here."

    "text": "China, UK, and Spies\n“British army delays King Charles cap badges over China spying fears”\n\nThe UK military is delaying events due to the concerns over the Chinese espionage through the ‘cap badge,’ the production of which goes through China.\nThe concern might not be entirely groundless due to the CCP’s track record of implanting bugs as well as the recent incident where two British nationals were caught spying for China.\n\n\n\nSanctions and Consequences\n“Billionaire under sanctions could get $300mn in controversial US-Congo deal”\n\nIsraeli tycoon Dan Gertler might have a significant financial gain due to the US sanction easing “if he sells his remaining mining interests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\n“Treasury would provide Gertler with “special” licences to sell the three royalty streams back to the Congolese government and would eventually grant him a “general” licence to regain access to the US financial system.”\n\nHe is under US sanction due to the corruption charges (2017). He will remain in the sanctions list and the easing grants him a ‘license’ to access US financial systems.\nCobalt and copper are the primary concern here. DRC mining business has been dominated by China, and the US is trying to put their toe in this critical supply chain.\n\n\n\nPutin goes to Pyongyang\n\n\nHis first visit since 2000. But Kim visited Russia last year and toured around sensitive military tech factories including missile production lines.\n“In the weeks ahead of Mr. Putin’s visit, Mr. Kim flaunted what he has to offer Mr. Putin.” (i.e., munitions)\n“Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms trade, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. But at the Group of 7 summit in Italy last week, the G7 leaders condemned “in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation” between the two nations”\nNK uses Russian crypto to launder the assets they acquired through state-sponsored hacks."

BREXIT, once a salient issue, is not as important any more. The economy (Liz Truss), health (longer waiting time for ‘elected care’), and immigration (consistently increased under the conservative rule) are more important than before.\nLabor is not in an overwhelmingly better position as they are forecast to lose some young voters (allegedly due to the their center-turn). Labor needs a comprehensive and substantial victory to win back the power. Their numbers hadn’t been quite there until recently, but they are improving now.\n\nThis nuanced point might be a bit too nuanced. The polls actually predict a complete wipeout of the Tories and an unprecedented victory for the Labor. For example: \n\n“One key test for Labour will be whether it can win back postindustrial heartlands in the Midlands and north of England, traditionally known as the “red wall.””\nThe Reform Party led by Farage could be a threat to the Conservative: “Unlike the Liberal Democrats, Reform’s voter base is spread thinly across the country, and, while that makes it difficult to win seats, it could split the right-wing vote across the country and cause the Conservatives to lose more seats to Labour.”\n\n\n\nChinese tech companies squeeze their workers for extended hours as their growth slows down\n“‘We’re like gears grinding until they break’: Chinese tech companies push staff to the limit”\n\nThe working conditions for the Chinese tech workers were traditionally bad. “But the unremitting schedule has improved in recent years under President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” campaign, which aims to reduce income inequality and promote fairness.” But as the growth of the sector slows down, they are going back to the “leaner and meaner start-up days.”\n“To boost their own efficiency, industry pillars Alibaba and Tencent have shed tens of thousands of staff since 2021.” The older workers are particularly in peril as their job market prospects are not great and the chances of redundancy high. Companies are searching for ‘young and unmarried’ workers.\nThe tech sector is considered the most coveted one among young Chinese, nonetheless because of its high pay.\nThere are some movements against the ‘996’ (9-to-9 for 6 days). “In 2021, with President Xi cracking down on personalities such as Ma, China’s supreme court declared the 996 schedule illegal. The victory did not come without costs.

They have dire illnesses,” Dr. Terdiman said. “When that chant goes up and is heard in the patient care rooms, which it clearly was, it’s a violation of our professional obligations as health care providers.”\n“U.C.S.F. has a dress code prohibiting political symbols in patient care settings, but Dr. Ghannam said staff members for years have worn pins supporting abortion rights, Black Lives Matter and the L.G.B.T.Q. community without repercussions.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Trump’s fund raising caught up with Biden’s\n“Trump Has Rapidly Eroded Biden’s Edge in 2024 Cash Battle”\n\nTrump “out-raised President Biden for the second consecutive month in May, outpacing” Biden by about $81 mn. Just two months ago, Biden had an obvious upper hand here (by about 100mn).\nThe felony verdicts probably drove the fund raising: “The Trump campaign has said it raised $53 million online in the first 24 hours and $70 million in the first 48 hours after the verdict.”\nNonetheless, ““But at the end of the day, Biden has the funds that he needs to run a really strong campaign.””\n\na related news article: “US banking heir gave Trump campaign fund $50mn after ex-president’s conviction”\nan opinion piece related to this: “Business leaders’ myopic reversal on Donald Trump”\n\n\n\n\nCentral Bankers’ limits [op-ed]\n“Markets ignore the internal politics of central banks at their peril”\n\n\n“Neither the US Federal Reserve’s Jay Powell nor the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde is a certified member of the central bankers’ club. Lacking the economics training and record, they must operate as deft chairs of technocratic boards.”\n\nPowell is a Georgetown JD (with a investment banking career); Largarde has law and English degrees (MA) from France with experiences in the law (antitrust) and bureaucracy.\n\nThe lack of their won expertise renders decision making ‘constrained’ by data. Even when they’d like to cut rates, for instance, the monthly inflation data readings would prevent it.\n\n\n\nCampus tension between Jews and Muslims\n“At Stanford, 2 Reports on Bias Show Extent of Divide Between Jews and Muslims”\n\n“One report documented antisemitic threats. The other, anti-Muslim threats. Both signaled that there may be little room for agreement.”\n“The report on antisemitism — by a university subcommittee on antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, consisting of faculty, students and an alumnus — found that acts of antisemitism have ranged from an anonymous threat on social media against a student journalist who had written about antisemitism to what students said was intimidation in the classroom and residence halls.”\n\nexamples: “a social media message calling for a student journalist to be “waterboarded with gas and set on fire” after he wrote an essay about antisemitism; an instructor who had told students that “only six million” Jews had died in the Holocaust, and compared it with the 12 million deaths in colonial Belgium; and mezuzahs, a religious talisman, being ripped from some students’ door frames.”\n\n“The other report — by Stanford’s Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities committee — described what it called “a rupture of trust” between students, staff and faculty. “These communities have felt afraid for their safety, unseen and unheard by university leadership,” it said.”\n\nexamples: “a threatening email from a Stanford alumnus to two undergraduate members of Students for Justice in Palestine with the subject line, “College Terror List — You Made It!”; a professor haranguing students at a pro-Palestinian protest, accusing them of doing “the work of Islamic jihad and Hamas”; and a printout of a Palestinian flag taken off a student’s door and ripped in half.”"

    "text": "Police Violence in Kenya (tax protest)\n“Police Fire Arms Amid Tax Protests in Kenya; 5 Reported Killed”\n\n“Demonstrators breached the Parliament to protest the passage of a bill that raises taxes.”\n“The turmoil over the finance bill, which includes the tax hikes, has shaken Kenya”\n\nThe bill was “introduced by the government of President William Ruto in May to raise revenue and limit borrowing in an economy facing a heavy debt burden.”\nBefore the protest, there were some precursors such as abduction of prominent critics of the government.\n\n\n\n\nICC arrest warrants for Russian officials\n“I.C.C. Issues Arrest Warrants for 2 Senior Russian Security Officials”\n\n\ncharges are the strikes against civilians in Ukraine (which is ‘symbolic’ gesture)\n\nICC: ““The expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage””\n\nthe context of the strike: “Their ambitious plans to take Ukraine’s capital in several days at the start of the war, which began in February 2022, failed spectacularly. They then sought to defeat Ukraine in what has become a grinding war of attrition, at the cost of at least tens of thousands of Russian soldiers’ lives.”\n\n\n\nGuyana - Exxon project\n“The giant Exxon project that could create the world’s last petrostate”\n\n\nAn oil reservoir of 11 bn barrels has already been discovered, leading to $55 bn investment.\nthe deal: “The consortium can collect up to three-quarters of revenue from the project until its costs are recouped. The remainder is split 50:50 with the government which also takes a 2 per cent royalty on production from the field — below the level in most offshore oil projects.”\n\nThe deal is very lucrative (for Exxon): ““The oil agreement we have is a legalised form of highway banditry,” says Glenn Lall, publisher of Kaieteur News, a newspaper in Guyana that has criticised both the government and opposition for mismanaging the relationship with the oil companies and argued that the Guyanese are getting “chicken feed”.”\n\nConcerns over resource curse: signs of inflationary pressure are already visible, bearing the disturbing resemblance to what happened to the Exxon project in Equitorial Guinea in 1995.\nEnvironmental regulators seem reluctant to hold Exxon accountable for possible disasters like oil spills."

Now, “[t]he takeover was “a golden chance to come forward and invest”.” China, Russia, and Iran are the potential customers.\nthe negatives\n\nsanctions\nthe natural resource revenues may embolden Taliban to pursue even more extreme policies\nthe investment is largely myopic with the government only interested in the short-term revenue maximization, which will “bite back” in the long run.\n\n\n\n\nThe Squad loses in the NY primary.\n“Democratic ‘Squad’ member loses New York primary on split over Gaza war”\n\n“Bowman was defeated by George Latimer, a local county executive, in a contest that became a showdown between progressive and moderate Democrats and was marred by allegations of racism and antisemitism.”\n\n“But Bowman antagonised many Jewish voters, who account for about 9 per cent of the electorate, with his criticism of Israel’s response to Hamas’s October 7 attack.”\nMany who didn’t vote for Bowman, however, state that the dissatisfaction is more with his lack of interest in the district than with his stance on Israel.\n\n\n\n\nNew NATO leader\n“Mark Rutte Moves From Leading Netherlands to Heading NATO”\n\n“Mark Rutte, the long-serving Dutch prime minister, was formally named the new secretary general of NATO”; a staunch opponent of Putin\n“Long a favorite of Mr. Biden for the post, Mr. Rutte served as the Dutch prime minister four times, for nearly 14 years, building complicated coalitions through debate and compromise. Those skills should serve him well in an alliance that works by consensus, where one country can block the intentions of the rest.”\n“Under Mr. Rutte, the Netherlands has increased military spending to more than the 2 percent of gross domestic product demanded of NATO members, and it has provided F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv while investing more in its own military.”\n\n\n\nSovereign debt restructuring is getting better\n“Sovereign Debt Restructuring Process Is Improving Amid Cooperation and Reform”\n\n\nThe Common Framework “started to deliver.”\n\nmade possible partly because “because stakeholders have developed more experience working together, including with non-traditional official creditors like China, India, and Saudi Arabia.”\n\noutside CF, the pace is getting faster too.\n“The IMF, World Bank and the Presidency of the Group of Twenty introduced the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) early last year to help overcome various disagreements on technical issues. Discussions among creditors and debtors have made progress on several key aspects, including comparability of treatment among creditors, defining what debts are included in the restructuring, information sharing, and processes and timelines.”"

It’s a “game-changer.”\n\n“The underground banks operate largely by selling the cartels’ dollars to wealthy Chinese who, alarmed at the political tightening … are looking to circumvent capital controls and transfer their money out of the country.” The capital flight from China is estimated to be $738bn in 2022.\n\n” Please use the sharing tools found via the share button at the top or side of articles.

The process was slow and expensive with many middlemen in between. Chinese groups offer the service at a much cheaper commission, effectively pushing out all competitors.\n\nThe primary way of laundering: ‘mirror transfers’ using Chinese bank accounts that are practically invisible to US authorities.\n\nCartels drop off USD cash to Chinese launders, who pay the cartels directly in the peso in Mexico. The USD cash launders have is sold to wealthy Chinese in the US, who repays the launders through Chinese bank accounts. The USD cash then could be spent on luxuries around the US (or college tuition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCP Suppression of dissents’ children in US\n“New Tactic in China’s Information War: Harassing a Critic’s Child in the U.S.”\n\na writer critical of CCP (currently in US) learned that his daughter in the US got harassed by sexually suggestive threats in social media and other crowd-sourced webpages (e.g., TripAdvisor).\n\n“A covert propaganda network linked to the country’s security services” is believed to be behind it.\n“The Spamouflage network” was first identified in 2019 (related to Hong Kong). “While the content often fails to go viral, the swarming nature of the attacks can be a nuisance, or worse, for those targeted.”\n\nThe story “fits a pattern” where CCP propaganda apparatus ramped up its efforts to discredit the critics through harassment–or ‘export of repression.’\n\nIn 2023, for example, 40 officers of China’s National Police were indicted for repression schemes targeting US residents. [State Dept’s Link]\n\n\n\n\nCoup attempt in Bolivia\n“Bolivian general arrested after apparent coup attempt”\n\n“Arce, a onetime protégé of former leftist leader Evo Morales, called on Bolivians to “mobilise against the coup plotters”. He then replaced Zúñiga with an army commander who called on the soldiers to stand down.”\n\nArce and Morales, though, are now “caustic[ally] split”\nMorales previously said “he will run against Arce in next year’s presidential election. His term was marked by democratic backsliding as he championed indigenous rights”\n\n“Juan José Zúñiga, who commanded the South American country’s army” was detained after a failed attempt to storm the presidential palace.\n\nthe demand included:\n\nnew government\nrelease of several jailed politicians, including two opposition leaders\n\nZuniga argued after the capture that the whole thing was orchestrated by Arce for popularity.\n\nNOT very clear who’s in charge and who’s behind the whole action–needs a follow-up\n\n\n\nEuropean commercial mortgage bonds\nTop-rated European commercial mortgage bonds set for first losses since credit crisis\n\n“Investors in several European commercial mortgage bonds that were originally sold with top credit ratings look set to suffer losses, say analysts, the first time since the global financial crisis”\nCause? “Rising borrowing costs over the past two years have triggered the worst downturn in commercial real estate since the 2008 global financial crisis”"
