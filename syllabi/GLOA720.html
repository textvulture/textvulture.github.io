<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Course Description</h1>
<p>Capstone Research Seminar offers an opportunity for GLOA MA students to draw upon the different skills and bodies of knowledge acquired and honed during the course MA studies. The goal is to prepare the students to operate professionally in a complex global environment that requires a range of analytical skills. We tap into your previous coursework which has so far trained you to think critically of your own orientations, worldview, and presuppositions. In this class, you will apply them to a specific research project of your choice. While we start out talking extensively about social science research methods, the course is <em>not</em> a research methods course. Nor is it a ‘repeat of GLOA 605.’ Rather, it sets out to explore ways in which we can link theories and concepts to methods in order to generate new knowledge and persuasive arguments. The underlying assumption is that in order to operate effectively in a global age, we need to know how to 1) produce knowledge and arguments and 2) assess and evaluate those made by others, their (implicit or explicit) presuppositions, blind spots, and understandings. The frequent presentations as well as peer-review assignments are to incorporate these assumptions into an effective learning process. In other words, it is a collective learning experience focusing on analytical speaking, writing, and communications. And it definitely does not aim to turn you into an academic. All those efforts will be reflected in your final outcome of the class, a <strong>capstone research paper</strong>.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind in this regard:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The paper will be your work and yours only. Nobody, not even the instructor, shall write a single word for the project.</li>
<li>You’ve been through quite a few grad courses, each of which came with quantities of readings. They are almost always results of good research projects. In other words, you know what a good project looks like. Trust yourself and don’t hesitate to go back to the syllabi of old classes.</li>
<li>Peer-review is an integral part of this course. Evaluating others’ work is the kind of function required of any profession these days.</li>
</ol>

<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-best"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> My Best Reading (5%)</h2>
<p>What was the single reading you liked the most in the grad classes that you’ve taken? Write a 300-word short essay discussing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you like it so much?</li>
<li>How is it better than others?</li>
<li>Is there any part of the reading that you want to incorporate into your project?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit this to the designated place in Assignment section of Canvas.</p>

<section id="sec-pitch" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pitch"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Pitch your idea (5%)</h2>
<p>Upload a video about a rough sketch of your idea for the capstone project. Things to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>research question</li>
<li>methods currently considered</li>
<li>(potential) data</li>
<li>any challenges or obstacles you foresee (if not already experienced)</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit the video as a ‘reply’ to the designated thread of Discussion Board in Canvas.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pitchr"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Peer Review of the pitches (5%)</h2>
<p>Provide written feedback on others’ pitches. No word limit. Offer constructive, problem-solving feedback. The gist would be ‘this would be how to make your project better.’ Some examples might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>methods that might be suitable for the topic</li>
<li>a particular way to execute the method to answer the research question</li>
<li>an existing study that employed a similar method</li>
<li>any related study</li>
<li>data sources recommendation</li>
<li>logical issues in the potential argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit this by posting a reply in Canvas to the pitch presented. Include in the text the word count.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-pitchr2" class="level2" data-number="3.4">
<h2 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pitchr2"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Pitch Reflection (5%)</h2>
<p>Reflect on the feedback collected. Once peer-feedback is provided by peer-reviewers, write a 300-word note about how you will be incorporating it into your project by the end of the week (midnight Sunday).</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge/summarize all of the feedback provided (in time).</li>
<li>If you think some of the feedback is not directly relevant or helpful, you can say that. But in that case, discuss why so.</li>
<li>Submit it to the designated place in the Assignment section of Canvas.</li>

<section id="sec-lr" class="level2" data-number="3.5">
<h2 data-number="3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-lr"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Literature Review (15%)</h2>
<p>Complete the research paper up to the literature review.</p>
<ul>
<li>For general instruction on how to write a research paper, see <a href="https://youtu.be/h-JuMI9bUF4">https://youtu.be/h-JuMI9bUF4</a>.)</li>
<li>You are expected to turn in a mostly-finished Literature Review of your paper as well as rudimentary Introduction and Theory and/or Argument by the deadline.</li>
<li>In the literature review:
<ul>
<li>include at least six academic sources (narrowly defined, such as academic books or peer-reviewed journal articles). You are also encouraged to use non-academic sources as much as you want including policy reports, blog posts, news or magazine articles, but they don’t count towards the 6 academic sources requirement.</li>
<li>highlight the contribution of your paper to the literature. This doesn’t have to be (or probably should not be) something grandiose. In fact, it has very little to do with ‘doing good things for the world.’ Boring stuff like ‘few people talked about X in country Y’s context’ is just fine. The important part here is to demonstrate ‘few people.’</li>
<li>include proper citations and references.</li>
<li>make sure to discuss theoretical stuff. By ‘theoretical,’ I mean general relationship between factors closely related to your project regardless of the empirical context.
<ul>
<li>If, for example, your topic is a cash transfer programs in Sudan, a theoretical piece you might need to discuss is a general discussions on the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, foreign aid, or micro-credit programs in a much broader and not Sudan-specific context. This way, you can situate your project in the literature and easily identify what the possible contribution can be.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 data-number="3.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pr"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Presentation (15%)</h2>
<p>Create a video of presenting your research project. Submit the video by ‘replying’ to the designated thread in Discussion section of Canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The video has to be longer than 5 minutes but should not be longer than 12 minutes.</li>
<li>You don’t necessarily have to ‘appear’ in the video (though preferred), but at least your voice needs to be in it.</li>
<li>To make it fair with everyone, it has to be a video, not a PPT file with your voice. Even if you’re using a PPT file with voice-over, record a video of it.</li>
<li>Clarity and succinctness matter. The following things need to be clearly presented in a simple way:
<ul>
<li>the primary argument</li>
<li>the contribution of the paper to the literature (or why your research matters)</li>
<li>the data and research method used</li>
<li>the conclusion</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Provide feedback on others’ presentations by making a reply to the presentation video (so, basically, a ‘reply to reply’). No word limit. Offer feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the clarity of the presentation</li>
<li>how compelling the argument presented</li>
<li>whether and how the empirical analysis actually support the argument</li>
<li>any alternatives to the arugment or data</li>

<h2 data-number="3.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-paper"><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Capstone Research Paper (45%)</h2>
<p>This is the most important part of this course. The Paper, just like a typical social science research paper, might have this structure:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Literature Review</li>
<li>Theory and/or Argument</li>
<li><red>Empirical Analysis</red></li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have all five parts in your Paper. Since by this time, you will already have the literature review (and rudimentary and theory) completed and the empirical analysis will be the major addition at this stage. Unlike a research design or proposal, you are actually implementing an empirical analysis.</p>
<p><em>Don’t wait until the literature review is completed.</em> Start working on your empirical analysis as early as possible. You will go through books, articles and/or archives to do a historical case study; you will do (virtual) interviews of people; you will spend quite some time in a subreddit to collect data (quotes and discussions) for a discourse analysis; or you will run a survey. You will implement an actual empirical analysis.</p>
<p>Several things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doability.</strong> I will say it again. Choose what is doable. If you haven’t, for example, taken any quantitative method class already, using a quantitative method is not a good idea. If you don’t know much about drug lords other than several Netflix shows (like myself), working on trans-border drug trafficking would not be a good idea as finding data is challenging. Pick something you are already familiar with. Go back to your undergraduate or 605 or 610 projects. Remember, the goal is to produce, to go through the whole process research.</li>
<li><strong>It’s going to be hard.</strong> You will find yourself spending hours after hours on Google Scholar just to find one obsolete paper; you will go through numerous comments on a news article that seem very much irrelevant; or you will write 300 words and delete 500 words, on a good day. Most importantly, you will for sure feel left alone in the middle of nowhere with no guidance. That’s very normal for anybody doing their own research. The waste of time, getting lost, and solitude are all <em>part of research</em>. Acknowledging it doesn’t make it easy but it’s good to know that you’re not alone on this.</li>
<li><strong>Proper citations and references are expected.</strong> By now, you should be able to tell if something is cited correctly. So apply that standard to yourself. There will be warning on citation errors before the Paper. Non-negligible citation errors in the Paper will be punished with grade reductions. This is important part of training. When you cannot cite things right, people (academics or not) scoff at your hard work and question your professionalization. It’s simple and easy to fix citations and references, so let’s not risk that.</li>
<li><strong>We all pitch in for surveys.</strong> The primary target population for the survey (if, and only if, you use one) will be the class. Everybody is obligated to promptly complete a survey that any of your classmates distributes.</li>

<p>All assignments are expected to be submitted electronically in Canvas. Do <em>not</em> email any assignments. They won’t be graded.</p>
<ul>
<li>For video submissions, YouTube links are preferred. You can upload your video to YouTube, set the video privacy as ‘unlisted’, and simply submit a <red>link</red> to your video. <strong>Kaltura MyMedia</strong> is also acceptable.
<ul>
<li>Do not attach your video file directly to our Canvas page, though.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical difficulties are not rare. Try to submit it early if you can.</li>
<li>If uploading a file, be sure to make it a MS Word or PDF file. Absolutely NO Pages file as it causes a problem in the system. You have free access to MS Office software as a Mason student. You can also ‘export’ a Page file as a Word file.</li>
<li>10% reduction in grade (e.g., one day late for a literature review submission will translate into 1.5 points reduction = 10% <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 15 pts) will be applied to a same day late submission (so it is still a good idea to turn things in no later than the day of the deadline—the damage would be minimal!). Additional 10% reduction will be added for each midnight (11:59 pm) until the submission.</li>
<li>For all the things that are not specified in the syllabus, strictly adhere to the GLOA MA Student Guide.</li>

<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-integrity"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>George Mason is an Honor Code university; please see the official <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/George-Mason-University-Honor-Code-2018-2019-final.pdf">University Document</a> for a full description of the code and the honor committee process. Don’t rely on Reddit or your friends. They don’t know and are very often misleading.</p>
<p>Remember, not being familiar with the Honor Code doesn’t constitute a sufficient ground to get your offense excused—anybody taking Mason courses (even a student-to-be) is subject to the Honor Code. Likewise, note that intentionality rarely makes a proper excuse. The principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely.</p>
<p>When you rely on someone else’s work, you will give that source full credit, typically in the form of an in-text citation and bibliographic reference. If you are unaware of what counts as plagiarism see here: <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/plagiarism.htm">http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/plagiarism.htm</a>. Students caught violating the Honor Code will receive a failing grade in the related course assignment and will be reported to the proper university authorities for further disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is also more than not commiting plagiarism. Lying, for example, is also an offense identified in the Honor Code. Let’s build our class on the foundation of mutual respect and transparency.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-of-artificial-intelligence"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>A Large Language Model (LLM), commonly referred to as AI, is a double-edged sword, in that it can help you research better but doing so could easily involve plagiarism/cheating. As a general rule, making an LLM ‘write,’ be it partial or entirely, is considered unequivocal cheating (‘consulting unauthorized materials’) and a direct violation of GMU Honor Code.</p>
<p>Doing so also risks committing plagiarism. The writing itself has to be yours and yours only.Note that a ‘light’ rephrasing (e.g., altering some words) is still plagiarism. Similarly, submission of an edited version of LLM-generated writing is still considered plagiarism.</p>
<p>LLM could be used in the <em>process</em> of research, the result of which <em>you</em> actually write about. A good example is to use LLM in finding topics. The more you dig in, the more useful the outcome. One way to see if you are using LLM properly is to see how much time and energy you’re spending on it. If it takes a lot of effort and committing many hours of time to a task, you are probably using LLM right (as a general rule, if what it does is simply make your life more comfortable, there’s a good chance that you’re violating the Honor Code).</p>
<p>Another way is to use LLM to find relevant readings, although this is proven quite unreliable. A lot of ‘new’ AI models (which are actually based on a couple of existing AI engines) boast about how good they are at this, but so far they really haven’t been.</p>
<p>You can also use AI to detect typos or <em>obvious/simple</em> grammar errors. However, if you let it offer basically the whole prose for you, then it’s considered plagiarism. An easy way to tell this is to ask youself: “Could I come up with this kind of expression/sentence myself?” If the answer is ‘no’ or ‘not sure,’ then you have to stay away from it. Remember, this is not a writing or literature class and, however elegant, your prose is not relevant for your grades. Only clarity matters.</p>
<p><em>Not bothering using an LLM in the first place remains a great option.</em></p>

<h2 data-number="4.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diversity-statement"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Diversity Statement</h2>
<ul>
<li>This section reflects in part Mason’s <a href="https://stearnscenter.gmu.edu/purpose-and-mission/mason-diversity-statement/">diversity statement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>George Mason University promotes a living and learning environment for outstanding growth and productivity among its students, faculty, and staff. Through its curriculum, programs, policies, procedures, services, and resources, Mason strives to maintain a quality environment for work, study and personal growth.</p>
<p>An emphasis upon diversity and inclusion throughout the campus community is essential to achieve these goals. Diversity is broadly defined to include such characteristics as, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation. Diversity also entails different viewpoints, philosophies, and perspectives. Attention to these aspects of diversity will help promote a culture of inclusion and belonging, and an environment where diverse opinions, backgrounds and practices have the opportunity to be voiced, heard and respected.</p>
<p>There’s a practical element here too. You (will) live in an increasingly diverse society where practicing inclusiveness might help you in the long run (even if you do not agree with some of these values!). You are strongly encouraged to check out important websites such as <a href="https://caps.gmu.edu/resources-and-self-help/anti-racism-resources/">Anti-Racism Resources</a> and GMU <a href="https://ulife.gmu.edu/religious-holiday-calendar/">Religious Holiday Calendar</a>. It is the obligation of the student to provide faculty, within the first two weeks of the semester, with the dates of major religious holidays on which they will be absent due to religious observances.</p>
