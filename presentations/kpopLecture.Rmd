# Why K-pop is a .green[**good subject**]?

--

## - commonly used to describe Asian male in US

--

### : boyish; docile; nerdy; non-threatening; weird; funny-violent; <br> .pink[effeminate]; .pink[asexual]

--

## - exoticization (e.g., Jackie Chan; Ken Jeong)

--

## - Are male K-pop bands also perceived this way?

--

## `r fa('rocket', fill='red')` Is this how K-pop took off ?

# Interview: 'K-pop masculinity unique'

> ### … [T]here’s definitely a .green[difference in how Korean idols and American men], you think, their take on masculinity. I think that American men are very, very tied to masculinity in their physique and male and kind of masculine fashion choices and, and appearances. K-pop, while they also appear very masculine, have a lot of feminine sides as well (White, F, 18).

--

.white[.]
> ### [i]t’s nice because .green[it’s different to how American culture perceives masculinity]. They’re ... a lot more emotionally available. In some cases, like they’re more willing to cry, show emotion and like, be touchy with their friends without it being like, perceived as gay (White, F, 17).

> ### And I think it’s .green[changed my view on what is masculine] and like, like for the longest time I was not used to seeing men express emotions and as much as like K-pop idols do. Like the first year I was kind of like almost awkward when I would see them cry and now I’m like, I expect men to be that emotional, I want to see them express themselves like that. Um, I want to see them take care of themselves like that so it’s, I think, changed my view on masculinity and .green[what is masculine and acceptable for men] (White, F, 26).

> ### ... I had a clear phone case with Jungkook photocard in it and I used to feel self-conscious. Like when people would like to see my phone, ... “who’s that?” .green[I felt kind of ashamed] and like self-conscious about it… somebody that is interested in K-pop would know what those are, but other people be like,"oh, it’s just words in a phone case." (Latine, M, 20)

> ### ... other people being like,“how can you find these people attractive? They look like girls.” I’m like ... toxic American masculinity is something that I don’t like … [M]y .green[personal… preference always being sort of like the pretty boy type], which is not really an American.… (White, F, 32)

# Conclusion: Perceived K-pop masculinity in the US
]
<br>
--

## - K-pop fans in the U.S. do not exoticize Asian male idols; they interpret K-pop masculinities as .purple[legitimate], attractive alternatives to the US hegemonic masculinity.

--

## - Fans across racial groups recognize Korean/Asian masculinity as culturally different but not deficient, .green[normalizing softness] rather than treating them as strange or feminized.
