# Why K-pop is a .green[**good subject**]?

--

## - commonly used to describe Asian male in US

--

### : boyish; docile; nerdy; non-threatening; weird; funny-violent; <br> .pink[effeminate]; .pink[asexual]

--

## - exoticization (e.g., Jackie Chan; Ken Jeong)

## - Are male K-pop bands also perceived this way?

## `r fa('rocket', fill='red')` Is this how K-pop took off ?

I think that American men are very, very tied to masculinity in their physique and male and kind of masculine fashion choices and, and appearances. K-pop, while they also appear very masculine, have a lot of feminine sides as well (White, F, 18).

> ### [i]t’s nice because .green[it’s different to how American culture perceives masculinity]. They’re ... a lot more emotionally available. In some cases, like they’re more willing to cry, show emotion and like, be touchy with their friends without it being like, perceived as gay (White, F, 17).

Like the first year I was kind of like almost awkward when I would see them cry and now I’m like, I expect men to be that emotional, I want to see them express themselves like that. Um, I want to see them take care of themselves like that so it’s, I think, changed my view on masculinity and .green[what is masculine and acceptable for men] (White, F, 26).

# Conclusion: Perceived K-pop masculinity in the US
]
<br>
--

## - K-pop fans in the U.S. do not exoticize Asian male idols; they interpret K-pop masculinities as .purple[legitimate], attractive alternatives to the US hegemonic masculinity.

--

## - Fans across racial groups recognize Korean/Asian masculinity as culturally different but not deficient, .green[normalizing softness] rather than treating them as strange or feminized.

## - Political engagement is not universally accepted within fandom, though the (.Blue[passive]) support is generally quite strong.

--

## - Higher .purple[partisanship] (i.e., more ’political’) ⇒ lower endorsement of activism.

--

## - K-pop in itself might .red[not] be the key driver of youth political activism.
