## - Relationships between different transformative events

## - Some more emphasis on coup and democratization

# Elite Competition and Strategic Uncertainty
]
<br>

--

## - .Blue[Uncertainty]: The inability of ruling and rival elites to know how future power relations will unfold. Generally high in the .orange[moments of uncertainty]

--

## - All dramatic events stem from .pink[shifts] in this uncertainty: 

--

- .Large[**Coups**: when elites believe the ruler’s hold on power is weakening and that seizing control could secure their own position]

--

- .Large[**Democratization**: when elites see uncertainty as too costly and prefer more predictable option (e.g., election)]

--

- .Large[**Autocratization**: when elites regain confidence in their dominance (i.e., undertainty `r fa("arrow-down", fill='red')`)]

## : Popular mobilization (protests, strikes, and revolts) determines the .purple[direction] and .Blue[depth] of transformation.

## Institutions, even weak ones, shape how uncertainty is resolved.

--

- .Large[Strong .orange[parties and bureaucracies] constrain opportunistic coups.]

## `r fa("tape", fill="purple")` Path-dependence

---

.full-width-blue[
# All connected
]
<br>

--

## - Different manifestations of the same underlying instability:

--

-	.Large[**Coup**: elite-led, institutional breakdown from above.]

--

- .Large[**Revolution**: mass-led, breakdown from below.]

--

- .Large[**Democratization**: negotiated settlement between elites and masses after instability.]
