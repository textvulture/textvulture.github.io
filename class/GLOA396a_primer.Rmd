# Every research uses .pink[methods].

### **methods**: .orange[The ways in which the conclusion of the research is presented and drawn.]

]

--

## - 'what is a good method' depends a lot on the purpose of the research project, which is often reflected in .Blue[research question].

--

## - It is therefore a great idea to identify what the research question is when evaluating a project (i.e., paper, report, or a book.)

--

## - Very often (though not always), straightforwardly presented in form of a .green[question] in the intro.

---

# For example:

> .Large["Rather than conceding and withdrawing, rulingparties in these Asian developmental states conceded andthrived. But why, when, and how do such "conceding-to-thrive" scenarios come to pass?" (Slater and Wong 2013, 718)]

--

> .Large["These descriptive similarities raise an explanatory puzzle: Why would two contentious waves that played out at very differenttimes in very different regions share these distinctivefeatures?" (Weyland 2012, 918)]

# Why do we care about all this stuff in this particular .pink[class]?

.content-box-green[
## 1. They help you understand the readings.

.content-box-yellow[
## 2. They help you evaluate the readings critically.

.content-box-red[
## 3. They help you come up with the Critical Reflection ideas.
