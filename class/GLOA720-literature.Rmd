# What .Yellow[Helps]?

--

## - read and mimic (the 'literature review' sections of .yellow[academic articles])

--

## - have a several-sentence .yellow[summary] for each study that you draw on
  - .Large[*usually* that's all you need]
  
--

## - group them together (e.g., tagging)
  - .Large[imagine a .yellow[map] of a bunch of bodies of literature]
  - .Large[.yellow[Zotero] <img src="https://www.zotero.org/support/_media/logo/zotero_512x512x32.png" width="30" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0" /> works best for this purpose]

### - the literature review section of any academic research (and thus, the references/bibliography)
--

### - the *Annual Reviews* (almost any discipline)

### - book reviews: no, not Goodreads and such, but book review articles in .orange[academic journals]

# Keep in mind:

### - There could exist a whole body of literature under your nose.

--

### - You don't summarize the entire field. Literature review is an instrument. 

--

### - Some studies are better than others. 

--

### - A good literature review naturally makes a good conlcusion.

--

### - Sometimes, just knowing the main argument is enough.

--

### - It's meant to be .pink[painful].
