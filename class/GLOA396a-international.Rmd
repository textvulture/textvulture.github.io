# Defeat in War: what does it do to an .Green[authoritarian] regime?
]
--
<br>

### - **Discrediting the regime**: contradicts autocrats claims (competence; devinity; nationalism).

--
  - .large[successful/ongoing war has regime-consolidating effects.]
  
--

### - **Elite fragmentation**: military .pink[and] political elites

--

### - **Mass mobilization**: unrest, strikes, and revolutionary sentiment

--

### - **Foreign intervention**: e.g., Japan (1952)

--

### `r fa('lightbulb', fill='red')` But, what about .green[democracies]??

--
  - .large[Seeing all the costly consequences, democracies rarely engage in a war where they don't stand a good chance to win (Reiter & Stam 2002: [Link)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691089492/democracies-at-war?srsltid=AfmBOool89VHuGMUCkQoL-GSUGWbmKmXMIe8B-UQWqIFIUuvKJRFLNVA)]

# Withdrawal of Authoritarian Hegemon (sponsor)
]
--

<br>

--

## The collapse of USSR & Nazi Germany

--

### - **Loss of coercive protection**: no more military backing.

--

### - **Ideological delegitimation**

--

### - **Elite defection and reform**

--

###	- **Mass mobilization**: much less chances of effective repression

.full-width-blue[
# Democracy Promotion (int'l legal commitment as coup blocker)
]

<br>

--

## `r fa('bullhorn', fill='orange')`  .green[Economic] and .Blue[Reputational] costs that are predictable

--

### - pre-coup consideration: unsure to join (smaller rents)

--

### - post-coup consideration: economic hardship + legitimacay crisis

--

### - "States with democracy clauses were .red[20–30% less] likely to experience coup attempts than those without" (Wobig 2015, 71)

--

### - Democracy promotion might not have .violet[visibly] dramatic effects (i.e., democratization). But they contribute to democratic resilience, which is often not visible.
