# What is democratization? (2)

--

## - expansion of enfranchisement

--

## - (more) competitive and fair election
--
  
  - .Large[numerous .orange[sub-]conditions: <br>e.g., freedom of speech, civil liberty, corruption control]


--

## - commitment to 'okay to lose' (democratic consolidation)
--

  - .Large[insulation from .pink[threats] (e.g., praetorians; juntas; foreign interference)]

---

# Traditional (& .red[limited]) Explanations for Demcratization 

--

## - distributive conflicts 
--

  - .Large[traditional accounts tend to focus on big structural contradictions.]
--

  - .Large[`r fa("circle-plus", fill='red')` highly repressive regime = .pink[mobilization] (few alternative)]
--

  - .Large[doesn't concern *HOW* it actually happens: 'theoretical black box']
--

  - .Large[More an attempt to explain revolutions `r fa("hand-fist")`]
  
--

## - non-transient, organized social groups
--

  - .Large[sustained resistance poses actual threats to the regime.]
--

  - .Large[help with the collective action problems]
--

  - .Large[Not a good explanation for .Blue[elite-led] democratization cases]

# - When subjected to extensive empirical scrutiny (Haggard and Kaufman 2016), .Green[neither] distributiion- .Green[nor] organization-centric explanations hold up well. 

--

# - Probably democratization involves a .yellow[diverse] set of processes.

--

# - Instead of seeking a unified theory, focus on the causal sequences and find some regularities to better explain the .pink[empirical reality].

# **We talked about:**

--

## - Patterns/paths of democratization. 

--

## - Didn't quite answer the WHY question quite straightforwardly, but some regularities are discussed.

--

## - Disruption events are necessary conditions.

--

## - Autocrats need to feel secure enough to concede (though not always).
