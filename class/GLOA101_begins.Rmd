## GMU has subscriptions to some of the major newspapers: **.green[NYT], .orange[FT], .red[WSJ].** You can bring one (only of these three outlets) up `r fa("hand", fill='purple')` at the beginning of class as far as it concerns non-US-centric, global news. 

## People doing this .pink[consistently] will be rewarded with +2% of class grade.
